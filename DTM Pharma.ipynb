The interaction of PDZK1 and NHERF1 with hOAT4 and hOAT4-Î was investigated by measurement of [ H] estrone sulfate uptake, cell surface and total cell expression of hOAT4. PDZK1 and NHERF1 enhanced hOAT4 activity in LLC-PK1 cells by increasing the cell surface expression of the transporter. In contrasts, these two PDZ proteins had no effect on hOAT4 activity in BeWo cells. The interaction of PDZ proteins with hOAT4 may be cell-specific. In placenta, a different set of interacting proteins from PDZK1 and NHERF1 may be required to modulate hOAT4 activity.'\n",
      " 'The purpose of the present study was to identify the biochemical mechanism(s) of the preventative and reversal effects of Chaetoglobosin K (ChK), a bioactive natural product, on inhibition of gap junction-mediated communication and connexin phosphorylation by the tumor promoting organochlorine compounds, lindane, and dieldrin. A fluorescent dye transfer assay was used to quantify gap junction-mediated communication and sensitivity to lindane and dieldrin. Analyses of connexin 43, PKC, ERK, GSK-3Î², Raf, and Akt kinase phosphorylation were performed by Western blotting. Pre-incubation of astroglial cells with 10\\xa0Î¼M ChK prevented inhibition of dye transfer by lindane and dieldrin, which correlates with stabilization of the connexin 43 P2 isoform, and addition of ChK after lindane or dieldrin reversed the inhibitory effect, which correlated with re-appearance of the P2 isoform. Using phosphorylation site-specific antibodies, we demonstrated that lindane, dieldrin, and ChK all activated p44/42 ERK, but only ChK activated Akt kinase. ChK also activated a downstream effector of Akt, GSK-3Î², and activation of both kinases was inhibited by Wortmannin. Wortmannin also blocked ChKâs ability to prevent dieldrin-induced inhibition of gap junction-mediated communication between RG-2 cells. ChKâs protective effects, both preventative and reversal, on lindane and dieldrin inhibition of gap junction-mediated communication are associated with stabilization and reappearance of the connexin 43 P2 phosphoform and may be mediated by the Akt pathway.'\n",
      " 'The purpose of this study is to examine the efficiency of sonoporation with minicircle DNA for the skin wound healing in diabetic mice. Minicircle DNA containing the human VEGF  was constructed and tested  . Diabetes was induced in 2-week old male C57BL/6J mice via streptozotocin (STZ) injection. 6\\xa0mm circular skin wounds were made on the mice back. After the subcutaneous injection of the minicircle DNA at the edge of the wound, the mice were exposed to the ultrasound irradiation for the sonoporation. Wound areas were analyzed until the day\\xa012. Blood perfusion and angiogenesis were evaluated using a laser Doppler imaging and CD31 immunostaining, respectively. Re-epithelialization was assessed by histochemical analysis using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Accelerated wound closure was observed in the mice receiving sonoporation of minicircle-VEGF , which corresponds to the markedly increased skin blood perfusion and CD31 expression. Histological analysis revealed that the minicircle treated wound tissues showed fully restored normal architectures as compared with the non-treated diabetic controls with the markedly edematous and chaotic morphologies. Ultrasound mediated gene therapy with the minicircle-VEGF  is effective for the healing of the skin wound of the diabetic mice.'\n",
      " 'To evaluate the tumor targeting potential of  -(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymerâgadolinium(Gd)âRGDfK conjugates by magnetic resonance (MR) T1-mapping. HPMA copolymers with and without RGDfK were synthesized to incorporate side chains for Gd chelation. The conjugates were characterized by their side-chain contents and r  relaxivity.   integrin-binding affinities of polymeric conjugates were assessed via competitive cell binding assays on HUVEC endothelial cells and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells.   MR imaging was performed on MDA-MB-231 tumor-bearing SCID mice at different time points using non-targetable and targetable polymers. The specificity of Î±vÎ²3 targeting was assessed by using non-paramagnetic targetable polymer to block Î±vÎ²3 integrins followed by injection of paramagnetic targetable polymers after 2\\xa0h. The polymer conjugates showed relaxivities higher than Gd-DOTA. Endothelial cell binding studies showed that IC  values for the copolymer with RGDfK binding to Î±vÎ²3 integrin-positive HUVEC and MDA-MB-231 cells were similar to that of free peptide. Significantly lower T1 values were observed at the tumor site after 2\\xa0h using targetable conjugate ( \\u2009<\\u20090.012).   blocking study showed significantly higher T1 values ( \\u2009<\\u20090.045) compared to targetable conjugate. These results demonstrate the potential of this conjugate as an effective targetable MR contrast agent for tumor imaging and therapy monitoring.'\n",

Poly(L,D,V) was randomly copolymerized using N-carboxyanhydrides of leucine, Î²-benzyl-aspartic acid, and valine. Oligo(LDV), consisting of 2-6 LDV units, were synthesized by solid phase protein synthesis (SPPS) method. Binding of Leu-Asp-Val, Val-Asp-Leu, and Leu-Asn-Val, and internalization of FITC labeled LDV by wild-type and integrin Î±  knock-down A375 cells were studied. Cytotoxicity of poly(L,D,V)-Dox, oligo(LDV)-Dox, and doxorubicin (Dox) was also determined on wild-type, integrin Î±  knock-down A375 cells, and normal human epithelial keratinocytes (NHEK). LDV was essential for the specific binding and internalization by cells expressing integrin Î± Î² . Cytotoxicity of poly(L,D,V)-Dox and oligo(LDV)-Dox was integrin Î± -dependent, while free Dox did not show this differential effect. No observable cytotoxicity trend was found when increasing LDV repeating unit. Poly(L,D,V) was relatively more effective than oligo(LDV) for the delivery of Dox to A375. LDV containing moieties bind specifically to integrin Î± Î²  expressing cancer cells. The binding, internalization, and cytotoxicity depend on the level of integrin Î± Î²  expression. Poly(L,D,V) and oligo(LDV) were both effective in the   targeted delivery of Dox to integrin Î± Î²  over-expressing A375 cells.'\n",
      " 'Human organic anion transporter 4 (hOAT4) belongs to a family of organic anion transporters that play critical roles in the body disposition of clinically important drugs. We have previously shown that the activity of hOAT4 was down-regulated by activation of PKC and up-regulated by PDZ protein NHERF-1. Here, we investigated the mechanisms underlying such regulations. COS-7 cells expressing hOAT4 were treated with PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or transfected with dominant negative mutants of dynamin-2 or Eps15 or transfected with NHERF-1. The internalization and the function of hOAT4 were then determined. We showed that hOAT4 constitutively internalized from and recycled back to plasma membrane. Transfection of dominant negative mutants of dynamin-2 or Eps15 into the cells, all of which block clathrin-dependent endocytotic pathway, significantly blocked hOAT4 internalization. Treatment of cells with PMA accelerated hOAT4 internalization, whereas transfection of cells with NHERF-1 attenuated hOAT4 internalization. Our studies demonstrated that i) hOAT4 undergoes constitutive trafficking between cell surface and intracellular compartments, ii) hOAT4 internalization partly occurs through clathrin-dependent pathway, iii) the down-regulation of hOAT4 activity by activation of PKC and the up-regulation of hOAT4 activity by NHERF-1 are mediated through alteration of hOAT4 internalization.'\n",
      " 'The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of permeant lipophilicity on permeant uptake into and transport across human sclera for transscleral delivery. Model permeants with a wide range of lipophilicities were selected and studied with human sclera. Uptake experiments were carried out to measure permeant partitioning into the sclera. Transport experiments were performed in side-by-side diffusion cells, and the permeability coefficients and transport lag times of the permeants across the sclera were evaluated. Permeants with higher lipophilicity showed higher partition coefficients to human sclera, and the apparent transport lag time also increased significantly as the permeant lipophilicity increased. No correlation between the permeability coefficients and lipophilicity of the model permeants was observed in this study with human sclera. A hypothesis on the different findings between the present and previous studies was proposed. Permeants with higher lipophilicity exhibited stronger binding to human sclera and would therefore lead to larger permeant partitioning to the sclera and longer transport lag time. The steady-state permeability coefficients of the permeants were not significantly affected by permeant lipophilicity.'\n",
      " 'Intradermal immunization using microneedles requires compatible immunoadjuvant system. To address this challenge, we investigated microneedles coated with polyphosphazene polyelectrolyte, which served both as microfabrication material and an immunoadjuvant compound. Coated microneedles were fabricated by depositing formulations containing Poly[di(carboxylatophenoxy)phosphazene], PCPP, on metal shafts, and their physico-chemical characterization was conducted. Microfabrication of PCPP-coated microneedles exhibited strong dependence on protein-PCPP interactions in solutions and allowed for high efficiency of protein encapsulation. 70Â°C thermal inactivation studies demonstrated a remarkable increase in functional stability of protein in coated microneedles compared to solution formulation. A potential for modulation of protein release from coated microneedles has been demonstrated through ionic complexation of PCPP with small ions. Microneedles containing PCPP coatings provide improved protein stability, modulated release, and protein-friendly microfabrication process.'\n",
      " 'The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of new 4-maleamic acid and 4-maleamide peptidyl chalcone derivatives against human prostate cancer   and  . From a series of 21 chalcones, the effects of the three best inhibitors of PC-3 and LNCaP cell viability on growth, including cell cycle changes, adhesion, migration, and cell invasion, as well as their ability to inhibit angiogenesis, clonogenic activity, and matrix metalloproteinases MMP-2 and MMP-9, were tested. The effects   were studied in PC-3 and LNCaP xenografts. Three of the examined chalcones reduced cell viability in both cell lines in a strong dose- and time-dependent manner. An inhibition of the cell cycle progress was observed. These changes were accompanied with the inhibition of cell adhesion, migration, and invasion as well as with reduced neovascularization in chick embryos, tumor colony formation, and MMP-9 activity. The   results demonstrated the strong activity of these structures as inhibitors of tumor development in nude mice compared to non-treated animals. The results suggest the multitarget efficacy of 4-maleamic acid and 4-maleamide peptidyl chalcones against human prostate cancer cells and emphasize the potential therapeutic relevance of these compounds.'\n",

Commercial lidocaine/prilocaine EMLA (Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetic) cream was used as comparative control. Lidocaine dissolves rapidly off the microneedles and into skin such that the 1-min wear time achieves or exceeds lidocaine tissue levels needed to cause analgesia. This therapeutic threshold (100\\xa0ng/mg) was estimated by measuring the total amount of lidocaine and prilocaine in skin following a 1\\xa0h EMLA application. When co-formulated with 0.03\\xa0wt% vasoconstrictor-epinephrine, the concentration of lidocaine in tissue was maintained above 100\\xa0ng/mg for approximately 90\\xa0min. 3Mâs sMTS can be used to provide rapid delivery of lidocaine for local analgesia up to 90\\xa0min.'\n",
      " 'To investigate the kinetics, mechanism and extent of MNP loading into endothelial cells and the effect of this loading on cell function. MNP uptake was examined under field on/off conditions, utilizing varying magnetite concentration MNPs. MNP-loaded cell viability and functional integrity was assessed using metabolic respiration, cell proliferation and migration assays. MNP uptake in endothelial cells significantly increased under the influence of a magnetic field   non-magnetic conditions. Larger magnetite density of the MNPs led to a higher MNP internalization by cells under application of a magnetic field without compromising cellular respiration activity. Two-dimensional migration assays at no field showed that higher magnetite loading resulted in greater cell migration rates. In a three-dimensional migration assay under magnetic field, the migration rate of MNP-loaded cells was more than twice that of unloaded cells and was comparable to migration stimulated by a serum gradient. Our results suggest that endothelial cell uptake of MNPs is a force dependent process. The   assays determined that cell health is not adversely affected by high MNP loadings, allowing these highly magnetically responsive cells to be potentially beneficial therapy (gene, drug or cell) delivery systems.'\n",

Our approach leverages the integration of intensive data mining and curation and computational approaches, including cheminformatics combined with bioinformatics, to suggest biological targets and their small molecule modulators. We now describe an approach that uses the TBCyc pathway and genome database, the Collaborative Drug Discovery database of molecules with activity against Mtb and their associated targets, a 3D pharmacophore approach and Bayesian models of TB activity in order to select pathways and metabolites and ultimately prioritize molecules that may be acting as substrate mimics and exhibit activity against TB. In this study we combined the TB cheminformatics and pathways databases that enabled us to computationally search >80,000 vendor available molecules and ultimately test 23 compounds   that resulted in two compounds (N-(2-furylmethyl)-Nâ²-[(5-nitro-3-thienyl)carbonyl]thiourea and N-[(5-nitro-3-thienyl)carbonyl]-Nâ²-(2-thienylmethyl)thiourea) proposed as mimics of D-fructose 1,6 bisphosphate, (MIC of 20 and 40\\xa0Î¼g/ml, respectively).

      " 'To investigate the metabolism of phospho-aspirin (PA, MDC-22), a novel anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory agent. The metabolism of PA was studied in the liver and intestinal microsomes from mouse, rat and human. PA is rapidly deacetylated to phospho-salicylic acid (PSA), which undergoes regioselective oxidation to generate 3-OH-PSA and 5-OH-PSA. PSA also can be hydrolyzed to give salicylic acid (SA), which can be further glucuronidated. PA is far more stable in human liver or intestinal microsomes compared to those from mouse or rat due to its slowest deacetylation in human microsomes. Of the five major human cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms, CYP2C19 and 2D6 are the most active towards PSA. In contrast to PSA, conventional SA is not appreciably oxidized by the CYPs and liver microsomes, indicating that PSA is a preferred substrate of CYPs. Similarly, PA, in contrast to PSA, cannot be directly oxidized by CYPs and liver microsomes, indicating that the acetyl group of PA abrogates its oxidation by CYPs. Our findings establish the metabolism of PA, reveal significant inter-species differences in its metabolic transformations, and provide an insight into the role of CYPs in these processes.'\n",

Various concentrations of PF127 gels were prepared using cold method.   drug release kinetic studies were performed using membraneless dissolution method. Stability of IL-1Ra was assessed by SDS-PAGE.   studies and   bioactivity of IL-1Ra were also performed on wistar rats. IL-1Ra loaded PF127 gels showed   sustained release of IL-1Ra, depending on the concentration of gel used. SDS-PAGE confirmed the stability of protein during its   release. PF127 gel also exhibited prolonged release of IL-1Ra in rats as compared to that of IL-1Ra aq. solution.   bioactivity of IL-1Ra loaded in gel was confirmed by its ability to inhibit IL-1Î²-stimulated induction of IL-6. When compared directly, IL-1Ra loaded PF127 gel exhibited prolonged   and   release, greater efficacy to induce hypoglycemia and inhibited IL-1Î²-stimulated production of IL-6 as compared to IL-1Ra aq. solution.

In adult primates, FcRn is expressed more highly in distal intestinal epithelial cells. However, mAb delivery to that region results in low serum levels, in part because apical surface FcRn binding does not influence mAb transcytosis. High FcRn expression in enteroendocrine cells could provide a novel means to target mAbs for metabolic diseases after systemic administration.'\n",

The BDI was implanted in the inferior fornix of the capsular bag after intravitreal injection of Con A and ensuing phacoemulsification in NZW rabbits; standard-of-care topical 0.1% dexamethasone drops served as control. DXM was quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry and pharmacokinetics of DXM in disease   healthy eyes was compared. All eyes were assessed clinically using slit lamp biomicroscopy and Draize scoring scale. Retinal thickness and histological analyses were performed to evaluate retinal edema, inflammation and implant biocompatibility respectively. In Con A-induced inflammatory uveitic cataract model the BDI controlled anterior and posterior segment inflammation as well as retinal thickening more effectively than topical drops. The exposure (AUC ) of DXM with BDI is superior in all ocular tissues, while topical drops did not achieve therapeutic posterior segment levels and did not control inflammation nor prevent retinal edema and architectural disruption.

Furthermore, the effects of the peptides on eukaryotic cell viability as well as their antimicrobial effect were tested. In addition, the disrupting ability of the peptides in the presence of bilayer membranes of different composition were analyzed. AMP uptake relative to penetratin was ~13% (PK-12-KKP), ~66% (SA-3) and ~50% (TPk). All four peptides displayed a punctate uptake pattern in HeLa WT cells with co-localization to lysosomes and no indication that clathrin-mediated endocytosis was the predominant uptake mechanism. TPk showed the highest antibacterial activity. SA-3 exhibited selective disruption of liposomes mimicking Gram-positive and Gram-negative membranes. PK-12-KKP is an unlikely candidate for targeting intracellular bacteria, as the eukaryotic cell-penetrating ability is poor. SA-3, affected the cellular viability to an unacceptable degree. TPk showed acceptable uptake efficiency, high antimicrobial activity and relatively low toxicity, and it is the best potential lead peptide for further development.'\n",

Nanosuspensions were prepared using the microprecipitationâhomogenization process. Spray drying of nanosuspensions was achieved using a lab-scale Buchi spray dryer. Formulation components appeared to have the most significant impact on redispersibility of spray dried particles. Absence of surface charge led to particles that could not be redispersed. On the other hand, charged particles stabilized with an appropriate sugar led to spray dried powders that were flowable and easily redispersible. Dissolution testing showed the presence of two phasesâa lag phase that represented dispersion of the loose aggregates, and dissolution of the dispersed nanoparticles.

Two weeks after oral administration of LHD into these cancer-cell-bearing mice, we evaluated the antiangiogenic activity of LHD. Although all cancer cells expressed the angiogenic factors, SCC7 cells had much higher angiogenic potential and grew rapidly after implantation into mice. When orally administered, LHD delayed tumor graft growth regardless of cancer types. Particularly, LHD powerfully diminished the SCC7-derived tumor growth. Also, the expression of angiogenic factors in all kinds of tumor tissues was decreased, thereby attenuating the neovascularization in tumor tissue. Our study shows that LHD has potent anticancer and antiangiogenic effect on at least three kinds of tumor cells.

The AUC values of MX in several tissues were significantly increased when MX was co-administered with 5,7-DMF. The most substantial elevations of MX AUC in the presence of 5,7-DMF occurred in the liver (94.5%) and kidneys (61.9%), which is in apparent agreement with the relatively high levels of mouse Bcrp1 expression in these two tissues. Bcrp1-mediated DMF-MX interactions occur both   and   5,7-DMF represents a novel and very promising chemosensitizing agent for the BCRP-mediated MDR due to its low toxicity and potent BCRP inhibition.'\n",
      " 'The aim of this work was to investigate the influence of the oily nucleus composition on physico-chemical properties and anesthetic activity of poly (lactide-co-glycolide) nanocapsules with benzocaine. Nanocapsules containing benzocaine were prepared with three different oily nucleus composition and characterized by mean diameter, polydispersivity, zeta potential, pH and stability were investigated as a function of time.   release kinetics were performed in a system with two compartments separated by a cellulose membrane. Intensity and duration of analgesia were evaluated in rats by sciatic nerve blockade. The greatest stability, slower release profile and improvement in the local anesthetic activity of BZC were obtained with the formulation using USP mineral oil as component. Results from our study provide useful perspectives on selection of the primary materials needed to produce suspensions of polymeric nanocapsules able to act as carriers of BZC, with potential future application in the treatment of pain.'\n",
      " 'To identify and understand isomerization products and degradation profile of different aspartate residues in an IgG1 monoclonal antibody. Recombinant IgG1 was incubated for extended periods of time in a formulation buffer at recommended and accelerated storage temperatures. Isomerization reaction products were analyzed using ion exchange chromatography (IEC), hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC), peptide mapping, and LC-MS. Model peptides with sequences containing specific aspartate residues in IgG1 were synthesized and incubated under accelerated conditions. Products of isomerization reactions of peptides were analyzed by reverse phase chromatography (RP-HPLC) and LC-MS. X-ray crystallography data from Fab of IgG1 were used to understand mechanism of isomerization reactions. A MAb containing labile Asp32-Gly sequence in CDR I region undergoes rapid isomerization reaction and leads to formation of isoaspartate (IsoAsp) and cyclic imide (Asu) forms. Isomerization of aspartate residues was observed in a non-CDR region containing Asp74-Ser sequence. Isomerization reaction at Asp74-Ser led to formation of Asu74 and trace isoAsp74. While isoAsp32 increased linearly with time, isoAsp74 did not increase during storage. Asu32 and Asu74 followed non-linear degradation kinetics and reached steady state over time. Isomerization reaction of two different model peptides containing Asp32-Gly or Asp74-Ser with neighboring amino acid sequences as those found in the MAb result in formation of IsoAsp. Observed levels of Asu and trace IsoAsp at the Asp74 site are unusual for typical isomerization reactions. In addition to primary sequences, pKa, solvent exposure and high order structure around aspartate residues may have influenced isomerization reaction at Asp74 in MAbI. Different degradation profiles from the two Asp residues can influence shelf life and should be carefully evaluated during product development.'\n",
      " 'To examine the precipitation and supersaturation behavior of ten weak bases in terms of the relationship between pH-concentration-time profiles and the solid state properties of the precipitated material. Initially the compound was dissolved at low pH, followed by titration with base to induce precipitation. Upon precipitation, small aliquots of acid or base were added to induce slight subsaturation and supersaturation respectively and the resultant pH gradient was determined. The concentration of the unionized species was calculated as a function of time and pH using mass and charge balance equations. Two patterns of behavior were observed in terms of the extent and duration of supersaturation arising following an increase in pH and this behavior could be rationalized based on the crystallization tendency of the compound. For compounds that did not readily crystallize, an amorphous precipitate was formed and a prolonged duration of supersaturation was observed. For compounds that precipitated to crystalline forms, the observed supersaturation was short-lived. This study showed that supersaturation behavior has significant correlation with the solid-state properties of the precipitate and that pH-metric titration methods can be utilized to evaluate the supersaturation behavior.'\n",

After adsorption of liquid SEDDS onto NeusilinÂ®US2, all powders demonstrated acceptable flow properties and content uniformity for development into tablet. Tablets with good tensile strength (>1\\xa0MPa) at the compression pressure of 45 to 135\\xa0MPa were obtained. Complete drug release from tablets was observed if the SEDDS did not form gels in contact with water; the gel formation clogged pores of the silicate and trapped the liquid inside pores.

In this study, we aimed to further evaluate the clinical potential of this scaffold, hereafter called âsilk sericin-releasing wound dressingâ, for the treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor sites by comparison with the clinically available wound dressing known as âBactigrasÂ®â. \\n                    characterization and   evaluation for safety of the wound dressings were performed. A clinical trial of the wound dressings was conducted according to standard protocols. The sericin released from the wound dressing was not toxic to HaCat human keratinocytes. A peel test indicated that the silk sericin-releasing wound dressing was less adhesive than BactigrasÂ®, potentially reducing trauma and the risk of repeated injury upon removal. There was no evidence of skin irritation upon treatment with either wound dressing. When tested in patients with split-thickness skin graft donor sites, the wounds treated with the silk sericin-releasing wound dressing exhibited complete healing at 12\\u2009Â±\\u20095.0\\xa0days, whereas those treated with BactigrasÂ® were completely healed at 14\\u2009Â±\\u20095.2\\xa0days ( \\u2009=\\u20091.99\\u2009Ã\\u200910 ).

The goal of this study was to improve   dissolution and   absorption of celecoxib (CEB), a model drug, by means of novel carbon-based nanoparticles prepared from the MSU-FC matrix. The MSU-FC matrix was synthesized by an inverse replica templating method using mesocellular silica template. A solvent immersion/evaporation method was used to load the drug molecules. The drug-loaded nanoparticles were characterized for morphology, surface area, particle size, mesoporous structure, crystallinity, solubility and dissolution. The effect of MSU-FC on cell viability was measured using the MTT conversion assay. Furthermore, the oral bioavailability of CEB-loaded MSU-FC in fasted rats was compared with that of the marketed product. Our results demonstrate that CEB incorporation into the prepared MSU-FC resulted in an approximately 9-fold increase in aqueous solubility in comparison with crystalline CEB. MSU-FC produced accelerated immediate release of CEB in comparison with crystalline CEB (pure CEB powder or marketed formulation) and the drug-loaded conventional mesoporous carbon particles. The relative bioavailability of CEB for CEB-loaded MSU-FC was 172%. In addition, MSU-FC nanoparticles exhibited very low toxicity. The MSU-FC nanomatrix has been shown to be a promising drug delivery vehicle for improving the dissolution and biopharmaceutical characteristics of poorly water-soluble drugs.'\n",

In each case, exposure and efficacy in human subjects were projected at the time of nomination (for development) prior to first-in-human dosing. Projections of area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in humans involved the use of one or more methods: (1) allometric scaling of animal pharmacokinetic data; (2) clearance projection employing   data (liver microsomes and hepatocytes); (3) chimpanzee as an animal model; (4) the species-invariant time method; and (5) the Css-mean residence time or âCss-MRTâ method.

      " 'To investigate the effect of 2-hydroxypropyl side group substitutions on the structure of Î²-cyclodextrin (CD) in water. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out on four HPBCDs that broadly represent a range of degree of substitutions in order to investigate the effect of substitution of Î²-cyclodextrin with 2-hydroxypropyl groups at various O2 and O6 positions of the glucose units. The 2-hydroxypropyl side groups located at the O2 positions widen the cavity entrance at the secondary OH position of the CD molecule. These groups are spatially more spread out but dynamically more restricted, due to the formation of a hydrogen bond network between the hydroxyl groups of the side chains and the glucose units. On the other hand, the 2-hydroxypropyl groups at the O6 positions are dynamically more flexible. The extent and the location of the substitution can affect the cavity structure of the CD molecule, and thus possibly the molecular encapsulation capabilities.'\n",

This peptide participates in kidney damage inducing fibrosis and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our aim was to describe potential therapeutic targets in AngII-induced EMT, investigating the blockade of different intracellular pathways. Studies were done in human tubular epithelial cells (HK2 cell line), evaluating changes in phenotype and EMT markers (Western blot and immunofluorescence). Treatment of HK2 cells with AngII for 3\\xa0days caused transdifferentiation into myofibroblast-like cells. The blockade of MAPKs cascade, using specific inhibitors of p38 (SB203580), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK; PD98059) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (SP600125), diminished AngII-induced EMT. The blockade of RhoA/ROCK pathway, by transfection of a RhoA dominant-negative vector or by ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 or fasudil, inhibited EMT caused by AngII. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a downstream mediator of AngII-induced EMT. MAPKs and ROCK inhibitors blocked CTGF overexpression induced by AngII. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, although blocked AngII-mediated kinases activation, only partially diminished EMT and did not regulate CTGF. These data suggest a potential therapeutic use of kinase inhibitors in renal fibrosis.'\n",

Vectors and DNA complexes were characterized by dynamic and static light scattering. Flow cytometry was used to quantitate transfection activity and cytotoxicity in CHOâK1 cells. About 5-fold increased transfection activity was obtained for a vector constructed with an outer shell of oligocations attached through acid-cleavable linkers, relative to a control dendrimer with an acid-stable linker. The most effective oligocation component of outer shells tested was spermine. Neither modification was associated with increased cytotoxicity. This vector design did not permit an evaluation of the benefit of combining endosome release mechanisms.

A series of insulins, acylated at B29 with fatty acids via glutamic acid spacers, were examined to deduce the structural requirements. Self-association, molecular masses and hexameric conformations of the insulins were studied using size exclusion chromatography monitored by UV or multi-angle light scattering and dynamic light scattering, and circular dichroism spectroscopy (CDS) in environments (changing phenol and zinc concentration) simulating a pharmaceutical formulation and changes following subcutaneous injection. With depletion of phenol, insulin degludec and another fatty diacidâinsulin analogue formed high molecular mass filament-like complexes, which disintegrated with depletion of zinc. CDS showed these analogues adopting stable T R  conformation in presence of phenol and zinc, changing to T  with depletion of phenol. These findings suggest insulin degludec is dihexameric in pharmaceutical formulation becoming multihexameric after injection. The analogues showed weak dimeric association, indicating rapid release of monomers following hexamer disassembly. Insulins can be engineered that remain soluble but become highly self-associated after injection, slowly releasing monomers; this is critically dependent on the acylation moiety. One such analogue, insulin degludec, has therapeutic potential.'\n",

THC levels in the ocular tissues (except cornea) were found to be below detection limits from mineral oil, surfactant or emulsion based formulations containing THC. In contrast, micellar and ion pair based THC-HG formulations produced significantly higher total THC concentrations in the anterior ocular chamber. In this study, although delivery of THC to the anterior chamber ocular tissues could be significantly increased through the prodrug and formulation approaches tested, further studies are needed to increase penetration to the back-of-the eye.'\n",
      " 'Clinical study has previously revealed that plasma concentration of 7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin (SN-38), an active metabolite of irinotecan, was higher in patients with end-stage renal failure than those with normal kidney function although SN-38 is mainly eliminated in the liver. Here, we focused on inhibition by uremic toxins of hepatic SN-38 uptake and down-regulation of uptake transporter(s) by uremic plasma in humans. We evaluated SN-38 uptake and its inhibition by uremic toxins, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate (CMPF), indoxyl sulfate (Indox), hippuric acid (HA) and indole acetate (IA), with cryopreserved human hepatocytes and HEK293 cells stably expressing hepatic uptake transporters, organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs). We also collected plasma samples from patients with severe renal failure to examine their effects on mRNA level of OATPs in primary cultured human hepatocytes. SN-38 was taken up by hepatocytes, which showed biphasic saturation patterns. The SN-38 uptake by hepatocytes was significantly inhibited by a uremic toxin mixture including clinically relevant concentrations of CMPF, Indox, HA and IA. Kinetic analyses for OATP-mediated transport revealed that the uptake of SN-38 by OATP1B1 was the highest, followed by OATP1B3. Among the uremic toxins, CMPF exhibited most potent inhibition of OATP1B1-mediated SN-38 uptake and directly inhibited the uptake of SN-38 also in hepatocytes. In addition, gene expression of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in hepatocytes was significantly down-regulated by the treatment with the uremic plasma. OATP1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of SN-38 was inhibited by uremic toxins, and gene expression of OATP1B1 was down-regulated by uremic plasma.'\n",

The concentration-time profiles of 2-oxo-clopidogrel and active metabolite (AM) in presystem and circulation system was determined in the cannulated rats. Also, the rat intestinal S9 and human intestinal microsomes were conducted to examine the formation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel and AM. Meanwhile, the esterases in plasma and intestinal fractions responsible for the bioconversion of vicagrel to 2-oxo-clopidogrel were screened by the esterase inhibition and recombinant esterases. The intestine was responsible for the formation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel and AM   and  , where carboxylesterases 2 (CE2) contributed greatly to the vicagrel cleavage during absorption. Other related esterases in plasma were paraoxonases (PON), carboxylesterases 1 (CE1) and butyrylcholine esterases (BChE). The findings rationalized the prodrug design hypothesis that vicagrel could overcome the extensive invalid hydrolysis of clopidogrel by the hepatic CE1 but experience the extensive hydrolysis to 2-oxo-clopidogrel and subsequent oxidation to AM in the intestine. This also supported the theory of improved pharmacological activity through facilitated formation of 2-oxo-clopidogrel, thus warranting much needed future clinical pharmacokinetic studies of vicagrel.'\n",
      " 'The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of using coated microneedles to deliver vaccines into the oral cavity to induce systemic and mucosal immune responses. Microneedles were coated with sulforhodamine, ovalbumin and two HIV antigens. Coated microneedles were inserted into the inner lower lip and dorsal surface of the tongue of rabbits. Histology was used to confirm microneedle insertion, and systemic and mucosal immune responses were characterized by measuring antigen-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) in serum and immunoglobulin A (IgA) in saliva, respectively. Histological evaluation of tissues shows that coated microneedles can penetrate the lip and tongue to deliver coatings. Using ovalbumin as a model antigen it was found that the lip and the tongue are equally immunogenic sites for vaccination. Importantly, both sites also induced a significant ( \\u2009<\\u20090.05) secretory IgA in saliva compared to pre-immune saliva. Microneedle-based oral cavity vaccination was also compared to the intramuscular route using two HIV antigens, a virus-like particle and a DNA vaccine. Microneedle-based delivery to the oral cavity and the intramuscular route exhibited similar ( \\u2009>\\u20090.05) yet significant ( \\u2009<\\u20090.05) levels of antigen-specific IgG in serum. However, only the microneedle-based oral cavity vaccination group stimulated a significantly higher ( \\u2009<\\u20090.05) antigen-specific IgA response in saliva, but not intramuscular injection. In conclusion, this study provides a novel method using microneedles to induce systemic IgG and secretory IgA in saliva, and could offer a versatile technique for oral mucosal vaccination.'\n",

Vehicle refinement was also done to mask phenylephrine bitter taste and achieve human subject acceptance. The optimized vehicle was tested with Î±-adrenergic active agents to suppress radiation-induced oral mucositis in mice. The ligand binding assay quantified dose- and time-dependent, saturable binding of [ H] norepinephrine. An ethanol:glycerol:propylene glycol:water (6:6:8:80) vehicle provided the best delivery and binding. Further vehicle modification (flavoring and sucralose) yielded a vehicle with excellent taste scores in humans.

Formulations were made of 0.6\\xa0mM degludec at 3 and 5 Zn/6 insulin monomers, and 0.6\\xa0mM aspart (2 Zn/6 insulin monomers). Self-association was assessed using size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) monitored by UV and orthogonal reverse-phase chromatography. Simulating pharmaceutical formulation, degludec eluted as dihexamers, whereas aspart eluted as hexamers and monomers. Combining degludec at low zinc with aspart increased dihexamer content, indicating hybrid hexamer formation. At high zinc concentration, however, there was no evidence of this. Simulating the subcutaneous depot by removing preservative, degludec eluted as multihexamers and aspart as monomers. Aspart was incorporated into the multihexamer structures when combined with degludec at low zinc, but there was no such interaction with high-zinc degludec. SEC using progressively diluted concentrations of phenol and m-cresol showed that dissociation of aspart into monomers occurs before the formation of degludec multihexamers. Insulins degludec and aspart can be combined without forming hybrid hexamers, but this combinability is dependent on zinc and preservative concentration, and requires that degludec is fully dihexameric before addition of aspart.'\n",

Thermal stabilities of sucralose-loaded basic CD-MOFs and neutralized CD-MOFs were investigated using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high performance liquid chromatography with evaporative light-scattering detection (HPLC-ELSD). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) results showed that basic CD-MOFs were cubic crystals with smooth surface and uniform sizes. The basic CD-MOFs maintained their crystalline structure after neutralization. HPLC-ELSD analysis indicated that the CD-MOF crystal size had significant influence on sucralose loading (SL).

      "['A major obstacle preventing oral administration of macromolecular therapeutics is poor absorption across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream. One strategy to improve transport across this barrier is the use of chemical permeation enhancers. Several molecular families with permeation enhancing potential have been identified previously, including piperazines. In particular, 1-phenylpiperazine has been shown to enhance transepithelial transport with minimal cytotoxicity compared to similarly effective molecules. To better understand how the chemistry of 1-phenylpiperazine affects its utility as an intestinal permeation enhancer, this study examined a small library of 13 derivatives of 1-phenylpiperazine. The efficacy and cytotoxicity of 13 phenylpiperazine compounds were assessed in a Caco-2 model of the intestinal epithelium. Efficacy was measured using the paracellular diffusion marker calcein as well as by immunostaining and confocal imaging of Caco-2 monolayers. Of the 13 derivatives, two enhanced the permeability of the fluorescent marker calcein over 100-fold. It was found that hydroxyl or primary amine substitutions on the phenyl ring significantly increased toxicity, while aliphatic substitutions resulted in efficacy and toxicity profiles comparable to 1-phenylpiperazine. Several potent derivatives, including 1-methyl-4-phenylpiperazine and 1-(4-methylphenyl)piperazine, displayed lower toxicity than 1-phenylpiperazine, suggesting promise in future applications.'\n",

The degradation of the polymers was evaluated   in solutions mimicking the gastrointestinal tract environment. The binding showed that an increase of the amount of HEA in the hydrogel lead to a decrease of the binding capacity. In addition, it was demonstrated for the first time that the hydrogels produced by SARA ATRP presented a higher binding capacity than similar ones produced by FRP. Finally, it was observed that copolymers of PAMPTMA- -PHEA showed no sign of degradation in solutions mimicking both the stomach and the intestine environment. The use of an advanced polymerization technique, such as the SARA ATRP, could be beneficial for the preparation of BAS with enhanced performance.'\n",

Online light scattering, refractive index and viscosity detectors attached to HPLC (ViscotekÂ®) were used to study aggregation, molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity of bovine serum albumin (BSA). Irreversible aggregates were generated by heat stress. Bulk viscosity was measured by an oscillating piston viscometer. As BSA was heated at a higher concentration or for a longer time, the relative contribution, molecular weight and intrinsic viscosity of aggregate species increased. Molecular shape was evaluated from intrinsic viscosity values, and aggregates were estimated to be more asymmetric than monomer species. The presence of aggregates resulted in an increase in bulk viscosity when relative contribution of very high molecular weight species exceeded 10%. For model system and conditions studied, generation of higher order aggregate species was concluded to be associated with an increase in molecular asymmetry. Elevated viscosity in the presence of aggregated species points to molecular asymmetry being a critical parameter affecting solution viscosity of BSA.'\n",

Anionic PAMAM dendrimers and control dextran probes were applied to an isolated perfused rat lung (IPRL) model and lung epithelial monolayers. Endocytosis pathways were examined in primary alveolar epithelial cultures by confocal microscopy. Molecular interactions of dendrimers with protein and lipid lung fluid components were studied using small angle neutron scattering (SANS). Dendrimers were absorbed across the intact lung   a passive, size-dependent transport pathway at rates slower than dextrans of similar molecular sizes. SANS investigations of concentration-dependent PAMAM transport in the IPRL confirmed no aggregation of PAMAMs with either albumin or dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine lung lining fluid components. Distinct endocytic compartments were identified within primary alveolar epithelial cells and their functionality in the rapid uptake of fluorescent dendrimers and model macromolecular probes was confirmed by co-localisation studies.

The particle size distribution and the morphology of the protein aggregates generated were similar for all mAbs, independent of the MCO method used. There were differences in both residual copper content and in chemical modification of specific residues, which appear to be dependent on both the protein sequence and the protocol used. All products showed a significant increase in the levels of oxidized His, Trp, and Met residues, with differences in extent of modification and specific amino acid residues modified.

In present work, we have selected Rivastigmine hydrogen tartrate (RHT), a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, which exhibits extensive first-pass metabolism, resulting in limited absolute bioavailability (36%). RHT shows extremely low aqueous solubility and poor penetration, resulting in inadequate concentration reaching the brain, thus necessitating frequent oral dosing. To overcome these problems of RHT, microemulsion (ME) and mucoadhesive microemulsion (MME) of RHT were formulated for brain targeting via intranasal delivery route and compared on the basis of   pharmacokinetics. ME and MME formulations containing RHT were developed by water titration method.

The developed ME and MME were transparent having globule size approximately in the range of 53â55\\xa0nm. Pharmacokinetic studies showed higher values for C  and DTP for intranasal RHT: CH-ME over RHT-ME, thus indicating the effect of chitosan in modulating tight junctions, thereby enhanced paracellular transport of RHT.

The objective of the current work was to investigate the impact of L-His on PS20 stability in aqueous solutions when subjected to forced oxidation and accelerated stability testing. The stability of PS20 in L-His buffer was compared with that in acetate buffer. Forced oxidation of PS20 in these two buffer systems was initiated by a free radical generator, 2,2â²-azobis (2-amidinopropane) hydrochloride (AAPH), while accelerated stability tests were carried out at 40Â°C. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry was utilized to monitor intact PS20 and to analyze degradation products. Our results demonstrate a dual effect of L-His on PS20 stability. During exposure to AAPH, L-His protects PS20 from oxidation. Stable isotope labeling of L-His with  C was employed for mechanistic investigations. The protection of L-His was abrogated when acetate was added to L-His buffer, implying that the anti-oxidative activity of L-His may be compromised by specific counter ions. The replacement of L-His by various His derivatives led to significant changes in the protection of PS20 against AAPH-induced degradation. In contrast to forced degradation, the addition of L-His promoted oxidative PS20 degradation during accelerated storage at 40Â°C in solution, generating mainly short chain POE-laurates. L-His exhibits a dual effect on the stability profile of PS20, protecting against AAPH-induced oxidation but promoting oxidative degradation during accelerated stability testing.'\n",

Despite STDC significantly increasing permeability of [ C]-mannitol, no enhancing effect was seen on [ H]-nicotine permeability with any of the permeation enhancers. Rather, SDS and DMSO retarded nicotine permeability, likely due to nicotine being retained in the donor compartment. The permeability results were complemented by the spatial distribution of nicotine and mannitol determined with MALDI MSI. The buccal permeability of nicotine was affected in an enhancer specific manner, suggesting that nicotine primarily diffuses via the transcellular pathway.

A model protein (DNase) was buffer exchanged into nucleophilic buffers before light exposure. Photogenerated products were characterized by tryptic peptide mapping with mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. Several buffer adductions on His residues were identified after light exposure. To understand the influencing factors of such reactions, the levels of adducts were measured for six nucleophilic buffers on all His residues in DNase. The levels of adducts were found to correlate with the solvent accessibility of the His residue. The levels of adducts also correlate with the structure of the nucleophile, especially the steric restrictions of the nucleophile. The levels of adducts can be higher than that of other His photoreaction products, including photooxidation and crosslinking.

Bulk and interfacial rotational/oscillatory rheology were used to study the viscosity, complex viscosity, storage/elastic modulus, Gâ and loss/viscous modulus, Gâ, as a function of time of aqueous formulations of BSA and their purified components. Viscosity/time profiles at steady shear for different commercial BSA products and lots showed viscosity increase, decrease and time-independent profiles at low shear rates. All lots showed shear thinning. BSA monomer and dimers/aggregates, in general, showed similar profiles. Addition of low levels of surfactant or high shear rates rendered all solutions to be Newtonian-like. Interfacial viscosity studies paralleled those on the rotational rheometer. Gâ\\u2009>\\u2009Gâ with viscosity increase and Gâ\\u2009<\\u2009Gâ with viscosity decrease over time. We provide a rational explanation for the time-dependent and source-dependent rheological behavior of aqueous formulations of commercially available BSA proteins based on the migration of protein and surface active impurities to the air/water interface within the rheometer plates leading to the formation and breakdown of protein networks. Highly purified proteins is warranted in rheological studies of protein drug product candidates.'\n",
      " 'Fast-acting insulin aspart (faster aspart) is a novel formulation of insulin aspart containing two additional excipients: niacinamide, to increase early absorption, and L-arginine, to optimize stability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of niacinamide on insulin aspart absorption and to investigate the mechanism of action underlying the accelerated absorption. The impact of niacinamide was assessed in pharmacokinetic analyses in pigs and humans, small angle X-ray scattering experiments, trans-endothelial transport assays, vascular tension measurements, and subcutaneous blood flow imaging. Niacinamide increased the rate of early insulin aspart absorption in pigs, and pharmacokinetic modelling revealed this effect to be most pronounced up to ~30â40 min after injection in humans. Niacinamide increased the relative monomer fraction of insulin aspart by ~35%, and the apparent permeability of insulin aspart across an endothelial cell barrier by ~27%. Niacinamide also induced a concentration-dependent vasorelaxation of porcine arteries, and increased skin perfusion in pigs. Niacinamide mediates the acceleration of initial insulin aspart absorption, and the mechanism of action appears to be multifaceted. Niacinamide increases the initial abundance of insulin aspart monomers and transport of insulin aspart after subcutaneous administration, and also mediates a transient, local vasodilatory effect.'\n",
      " 'To explore how the natural heterogeneity of human coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) and the processing of its B-domain specifically modulate protein aggregation. Recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) molecular species containing 70% or 20% B-domain, and B-domain-deleted rFVIII (BDD-rFVIII), were separated from full-length recombinant FVIII (FL-rFVIII). Purified human plasma-derived FVIII (pdFVIII) was used as a comparator. Heterogeneity and aggregation of the various rFVIII molecular species, FL-rFVIII and pdFVIII were analysed by SDS-PAGE, dynamic light scattering, high-performance size-exclusion chromatography and flow cytometry-based particle analysis. FL-rFVIII and pdFVIII were heterogeneous in nature and demonstrated similar resistance to aggregation under physical stress. Differences were observed between these and among rFVIII molecular species. FVIII molecular species exhibited diverging aggregation pathways dependent on B-domain content. The propensity to form aggregates increased with decreasing proportions of B-domain, whereas the opposite was observed for oligomer formation. Development of cross-Î² sheet-containing aggregates in BDD-rFVIII induced effective homologous seeding and faster aggregation. Naturally heterogeneous FL-rFVIII and pdFVIII displayed the lowest propensity to aggregate in all experiments. These results demonstrate that pdFVIII and FL-rFVIII have similar levels of molecular heterogeneity, and suggest that heterogeneity and the B-domain are involved in stabilising FVIII by modulating its aggregation pathway.'\n",
      " 'Despite encouraging preclinical results, mechanisms of CNS drug delivery following intranasal dosing of nanoemulsions remain incompletely understood. Herein, the transport characteristics of intranasally administered nanoemulsions are investigated using mathematical modeling and simulation. A compartmental model was developed to describe systemic and brain pharmacokinetics of drug solutions following intranasal dosing in rodents. The association between transport processes and CNS drug delivery was predicted using sensitivity analysis. Published pharmacokinetic data for four drugs; dosed as a nanoemulsion and aqueous solution were modeled to characterize differences in transport processes across formulations. The intranasal model structure performed in a drug agnostic fashion. Sensitivity analysis suggested that though the extent of CNS drug delivery depends on nasal bioavailability, the CNS targeting efficiency is only sensitive to changes in drug permeability across the nasal epithelium. Modeling results indicated that nanoemulsions primarily improve nasal bioavailability and drug permeability across the olfactory epithelium, with minimal effect on drug permeability across the non-olfactory epithelium. Using mathematical modeling we outlined dominant transport pathways following intranasal dosing, predicted the association between transport pathways and CNS drug delivery, predicted human CNS delivery after accounting for inter-species differences in nasal anatomy, and quantified the CNS delivery potential of different formulations in rodents.'\n",
      " 'To provide new insights into how protein-surfactant competitive adsorbtion and corresponding surface tension reduction properties at the air-water and oil-water interface are impacted by the type of protein and the associated protein surface rheology. Interfacial Rheology was utilized to obtain surface Gâ and Gâ as a function of frequency. Force tensiometry was utilized to obtain changes in surface tension as a function of surfactant concentration. The impact on surface properties of two different proteins i.e. BSA and Lysozyme was investigated as a function of surfactant concentration i.e. polysorbates PS 20, PS 80 and Poloxomer (Kolliphor P188). Surface tension and interfacial tension measurements for BSA showed that in mixed BSA/polysorbate surfactant systems, BSA dominates the interfacial behavior at both the air-water and oil-water interfaces, until a high polysorbate concentration of 0.1\\xa0mg/ml. At these high polysorbate concentrations a mixed BSA-Polysorbate interfacial layer is formed as corroborated by the surface elasticity values being lower than that of pure BSA but higher than that of pure Polysorbate. For Kolliphor, it was observed that Kolliphor was unable to displace BSA at any concentration. This is corroborated by the high surface elasticity of the BSA which is maintained in the presence of Kolliphor. Surface and interfacial tension measurements for lysozyme show that for mixed lysozyme/polysorbate surfactant systems, the surface tension values are lower than that exhibited by either the lysozyme or the polysorbate surfactants. This potentially indicates the formation of a mixed layer of lysozyme and polysorbate. At the high polysorbate concentrations probed, the surface elasticity values are however closer to that of pure polysorbates, indicating that the mixed layer may be more heavily polysorbate dominated, especially at high polysorbate concentrations. For Kolliphor, the response was similar to that seen in the Kolliphor-BSA system in which the Kolliphor was not able to displace the protein i.e. Lysozyme. In conclusion, it was seen that competitive adsorption between proteins and common excipient surfactants is dictated by the type of protein and its effective structuring/rigidity at the surface as reflected through surface elasticity and surface tan delta values. BSA was seen to exhibit a higher surface elasticity than lysozyme, and therefore has a more rigid structure and is more competitive at the interface.'\n",

It is hypothesized to have advantages such as enhancing tissue uptake, distributing drugs homogeneously within the closed and expanded abdominal cavity and higher local concentration of drugs in the peritoneal cavity. However, the clinical trials of PIPAC so far are limited to liquid chemotherapeutic solution, and the applicability of biomolecules (such as mRNA, siRNA and oligonucleotide) is not known. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of administrating mRNA lipoplexes to the peritoneal cavity via high pressure nebulization. We firstly investigated the influences of nebulization on physicochemical properties and   transfection efficiency of mRNA lipoplexes. Then, mRNA lipoplexes were delivered to healthy rats through intravenous injection, intraperitoneal injection and PIPAC, respectively. mRNA lipoplexes can withstand the high pressure applied during the PIPAC procedure  . Bioluminescence localized to the peritoneal cavity of rats after administration by IP injection and nebulization, while intravenous injection mainly induced protein expression in the spleen. This study demonstrated that local nebulization is feasible to apply mRNA complexes in the peritoneal cavity during a PIPAC procedure.']\n",

The spray dried samples were stored at 20%, 55% and 75% relative humidity (RH). Crystallinity was monitored by Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD), and particle morphology was measured by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Aerosol performance was evaluated using a multi-stage liquid impinger (MSLI). PXRD diffractograms showed the spray dried Ciprofloxacin stored at 20% RH for three weeks were amorphous; whereas those stored at 55% RH and 75% RH started crystallizing after one hour. Fine particle fraction (FPF) of the particles was improved from 28% to 42% after storage at 55% RH for three days. Such improvement was attributed to the crystallization of amorphous powders, which led to increased particle roughness and reduced particulate contact area, as visualized by SEM and quantified by AFM. A linear relationship was observed between degree of crystallinity/crystallite size and FPF (R \\u2009=\\u20090.94 and R \\u2009=\\u20090.96, respectively). However, deterioration in aerosol performance was observed after storage at 75% RH due to formation of inter-particulate liquid/solid bridges, as confirmed by SEM.

      " 'The purpose of the research described herein was to develop a kinetic model for quantifying the effects of conditional and compositional variations on non-covalent polymorphic and covalent chemical transformations of gabapentin. Kinetic models that describe the relationship between polymorphs and degradation product in a series of sequential or parallel steps were devised based on analysis of the resultant concentration time profiles. Model parameters were estimated using non-linear regression and Bayesian methods and evaluated in terms of their quantitative relationship to compositional and conditional variations. The model was constructed in which co-milling gabapentin with excipients determined three physically-initial concentrations (II *, II  and III ) and one chemically-initial concentration (lactam ). For chemical transitions, no humidity effect was present but the catalytic effects of excipients on the conversion of II and IIIâlactam were observed. For physical transition, excipient primarily influenced the physical state transition of IIIâII through its ability to interact with humidity. This model was shown to be robust to quantitatively account for the effects of temperature, humidity and excipient on rate constants associated with kinetics for each physical and chemical transition.'\n",

Ethanol solutions containing a model drug (IMC, NMP or FCZ) and a model polymer (PVPK12, PVPK30 or PVP-VA) were spray dried, and the surface composition of SDDs was analyzed by XPS. The surface tensions of pure components and their solutions were measured using Wilhelmy plate and/or calculated using ACD/Labs. NMR and DLS were used to obtain the diffusion coefficients of IMC, NMP, PVPK12 and PVPK30 in solvents. Flory-Huggins interaction parameters for selected drug-polymer pairs were obtained using a melting point depression method. Significant surface enrichment or depletion of the drug was observed in SDDs depending on the particular drug-polymer combination. With PVP as the dispersion polymer, IMC and NMP were surface enriched; whereas FCZ, a hydrophilic drug, was surface depleted. With increasing PVP molecular weight, the surface drug concentration increased, and the effect was greater in the NMP/PVP and FCZ/PVP systems than in the IMC/PVP system where strong drug-polymer interaction existed. Changing the polymer from PVP to PVP-VA reduced the surface concentration of the drug. The surface concentration of a SDD can be significantly different from the bulk concentration. The main results of this work are consistent with the notion that the relative surface tensions control surface enrichment or depletion. Besides, the relative diffusion rates of the components and the strength of their interactions may also affect the surface composition of the SDDs.'\n",

Azithromycin is effective against some bacteria that cause respiratory tract infections; but it has poor water solubility that may limit its efficacy when administrated as inhalation therapy. In this study, dry powder inhaler formulations were developed by co-spray drying azithromycin with L-leucine with a purpose to improve dissolution. The produced powder formulations were characterized regarding particle size, morphology, surface composition and   aerosolization performance.

The spray dried azithromycin alone formulation exhibited a satisfactory aerosol performance with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 62.5\\u2009Â±\\u20094.1%. Addition of L-leucine in the formulation resulted in no significant change in particle morphology and FPF, which can be attributed to enrichment of azithromycin on the surfaces of composite particles. Importantly, compared with the spray-dried amorphous azithromycin alone powder, the co-spray dried powder formulations of azithromycin and L-leucine demonstrated a substantially enhanced   dissolution rate. Such enhanced dissolution of azithromycin could be attributed to the formation of composite system and the acidic microenvironment around azithromycin molecules created by the dissolution of acidic L-leucine in the co-spray dried powder. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic data showed intermolecular interactions between azithromycin and L-leucine in the co-spray dried formulations. We developed the dry powder formulations with satisfactory aerosol performance and enhanced dissolution for a poorly water soluble weak base, azithromycin, by co-spray drying with an amino acid, L-leucine.'\n",

Crystallization of a model compound, 2-phenylamino nicotinic acid (2PNA), from the amorphous state was studied using solid-state analytical methods. Our previous report suggests that 2PNA molecules mainly develop intermolecular âCOOHâââpyridine N (acid-pyridine) interactions in the amorphous state. In the current study, the molecular speciation is explored with regard to the phase transition from the amorphous to the crystalline state. Using spectroscopic techniques, the molecular interactions and structural evolvement during the recrystallization from the glassy state were investigated. The results unveiled that the structurally heterogeneous amorphous state contains acid-pyridine aggregates â either as hydrogen-bonded neutral molecules or as zwitterions â as well as a population of carboxylic acid dimers. Phase transition from the amorphous state results in crystal structures composed of carboxylic acid dimer (acid-acid) synthon or acid-pyridine chains depending on the crystallization conditions employed.

Blends of Î±-indomethacin and PEG 3350 ( /w 4:1) were granulated using various screw sizes/designs on the melt extruder under different temperature regimes. Differential Scanning Calorimetry and X-ray Powder Diffraction were employed for characterization. The dissolution behavior of the pure polymorphs and the resulting granules was determined using in-situ fiber optic UV testing system. An XRPD quantitation method using Excel full pattern fitting was developed to determine the concentration of each constituent (amorphous, Î± and Î³ indomethacin and PEG) in samples collected from each functioning zone and in granules. Analysis of in-process samples and granules revealed that higher temperature (â¥130Â°C) and shear stress accelerated the process induced phase transitions from amorphous and/or the Î± form to Î³ indomethacin during heating stage. However, rapid cooling resulted in an increased percentage of the Î± form allowing isolation of the meta-stable form. By determining the conditions that either prevent or facilitate process induced transformations of IMC polymorphs during melt granulation, a design space was developed to control the polymorph present in the resulting granules. This represents the conditions necessary to balance the thermodynamic relationships between the polymorphs of the IMC system and the kinetics of the possible transformations as a function of the processing stresses.'\n",

The effective water absorption coefficient,  , exponentially increased to the water activity of the trehalose sample,  , at 25Â°C and 40Â°C at which the increasing rates are comparable. The surface energy of trehalose dihydrate,  , was found to be lower than the value calculated from the reported equation, neglecting the effects of the activity of the solute and solvent water. The retained water in trehalose considerably increases its affinity for water vapor, and the change in this affinity with regard to the water activity is nearly independent of temperature.

The aim of this work is to investigate the effect of buffers on protein stabilization given by sugars during freeze drying. Molecular Dynamics simulations of human growth hormone (hGH) in the presence of sucrose and trehalose were performed, and the impact of phosphate and citrate buffers on their protective action was analyzed. We found that buffers broke the hydrogen bonding network formed by excipients, and the consequences of this disruption of structure ordering were different in sucrose-based or trehalose-based formulations. More specifically, we observed that buffers increased protein recovery in the presence of excipients, such as sucrose, that exert their action mainly by preferential exclusion. By contrast, the opposite effect was sometimes noted in the case of excipients, such as trehalose, whose protective action is related to the formation of a highly structured matrix. We found that buffers have important properties, other than the control of pH, that can contribute to the overall stability of proteins. Some of these properties are related to their interaction with the other components of the formulation.'\n",

We used synchrotron X-ray diffractometry (XRD) to spatially map and thereby comprehensively characterize mannitol phase composition in unperturbed lyophiles. Low temperature thermal analysis and XRD was used to study phase behavior of frozen systems.

The main objective of this study was to understand the effects of surface composition on the dissolution of spray dried azithromycin powders by itself and in combination with colistin. Composite formulations of azithromycin (a poorly water-soluble molecule) and colistin (a water-soluble molecule) were produced by spray drying. The resultant formulations were characterized for particle size, morphology, surface composition, solid-state properties, solubility and dissolution. The results demonstrate that surfaces composition has critical impacts on the dissolution of composite formulations. Colistin was shown to increase the solubility of azithromycin. For composite formulations with no surface colistin, azithromycin released at a similar dissolution rate as the spray-dried azithromycin alone. An increase in surface colistin concentration was shown to accelerate the dissolution of azithromycin. The dissolution of colistin from the composite formulations was significantly slower than the spray-dried pure colistin. In addition, FTIR spectrum showed intermolecular interactions between azithromycin and colistin in the composite formulations, which could contribute to the enhanced solubility and dissolution of azithromycin. Our study provides fundamental understanding of the effects of surface concentration of colistin on azithromycin dissolution of co-spray-dried composite powder formulations.'\n",

When the frozen solutions were heated, two eutectics were observed â the first at ~ â24Â°C (ternary, NaClâ¢2H O-KCl-ice) and the second at ~ â22Â°C (binary, NaClâ¢2H O-ice). Trehalose completely inhibited buffer salt crystallization, whereas mannitol suppressed it partially thereby attenuating the magnitude of pH shift. The two eutectic meltings were also suppressed by the cosolutes. XRD of final lyophiles from PBS alone revealed peaks of anhydrous Na HPO , NaCl, and KCl. Trehalose rendered the lyophiles completely XRD amorphous, whereas in presence of mannitol, all the solutes except KH PO  crystallized. Freezing of PBS solution caused a pronounced pH shift due to selective crystallization of Na HPO â¢12H O. The addition of trehalose or mannitol suppressed the buffer salt crystallization and attenuated the magnitude of pH shift. The potential instability of biologics due to pH shift in PBS, can be potentially mitigated with the cosolutes.'\n",

Indomethacin (Î³-form) was purchased and used to prepare the Î± polymorph. Powder X-ray diffraction was used to confirm phase identity, while p-BLS was used to obtain the mechanical properties. Energy frameworks were determined with Crystal Explorer to visualize the interaction topologies. Using a Carver press and a stress-strain analyzer, the tableting performance of each polymorph was determined.

The p-BLS spectra for Î±-indomethacin display a population of low-velocity shear modes, indicating a direction of facilitated shear. This improves slip-mediated plasticity and tabletability. Our p-BLS spectra experimentally indicates that a low-energy slip system is available to Î±-indomethacin which supports ours and previous energy framework calculations. Despite a 2d-layered crystal motif favorable for shear deformation, the Î³-form displays a higher shear modulus that is supported by our hydrogen-bonding analysis of Î³-indomethacin. Our experimental, mechanical data is consistent with the predicted interaction topologies and these two inputs combined permit a comprehensive, molecular understanding of polymorph-specific tabletability.'\n",
      " 'With the recent approval of the first small interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutic formulated as nanoparticles, there is increased incentive for establishing the factors of importance for the design of stable solid dosage forms of such complex nanomedicines. The aims of this study were:   to identify factors of importance for the design of spray-dried siRNA-loaded lipidoid-poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) hybrid nanoparticles (LPNs), and   to evaluate their influence on the resulting powders by using a quality-by-design approach. Critical formulation and process parameters were linked to critical quality attributes (CQAs) using design of experiments, and an optimal operating space (OOS) was identified. A series of CQAs were identified based on the quality target product profile. The loading (ratio of LPNs to the total solid content) and the feedstock concentration were determined as critical parameters, which were optimized systematically. Mannitol was chosen as stabilizing excipient due to the low water content of the resulting powders. The loading negatively affected the colloidal stability of the LPNs, whereas feedstock concentration correlated positively with the powder particle size. The optimal mannitol-based solid formulation, defined from the OOS, displayed a loading of 5% (w/w), mass median aerodynamic diameter of 3.3\\u2009Â±\\u20090.2\\xa0Î¼m, yield of 60.6\\u2009Â±\\u20096.6%, and a size ratio of 1.15\\u2009Â±\\u20090.03. Dispersed micro-embedded LPNs had preserved physicochemical characteristics as well as   siRNA release profile and gene silencing, as compared to non-spray-dried LPNs. The optimal solid dosage forms represent robust formulations suitable for higher scale-up manufacturing.'\n",
      " 'Amorphous indomethacin (IMC) forms gel with a decreased dissolution behavior compared to crystalline IMC during dissolution. The current study aims to explore gelation mechanism and attempt to eliminate gelling effect by formulation development. Amorphous IMC was prepared by melt-quenching method. Dissolution tests of amorphous IMC were performed at various temperatures under sink condition. The formed gels were characterized by PLM, SEM, DSC and XRPD. Amorphous IMC exhibited an initial higher dissolution followed by a decreased dissolution lower than its crystalline counterpart at 32 and 37Â°C, and even a much lower dissolution during the whole dissolution period at 45Â°C. Meanwhile, a viscous soft mass (âgelâ) was observed to adhere upon the paddle or wall of the vessel. The formed gel could be characterized as a three-dimensional dense micro-fiber structure under SEM. The gel formation was proposed to be related to the decreased T  of amorphous IMC when contacting aqueous medium, resulting in entering into supercooled liquid state with high viscosity. The addition of hydrophilic silica accelerated gel formation, while mixing with hydrophobic silica was able to weaken and even eliminate the gelation, and hence significantly enhancing dissolution. The present study recommends that gel formation should be included in the investigation of amorphous materials in order to find ways for resolving defects of amorphous materials while keeping their advantages in pharmaceutics.'\n",
      " 'Traditional methods for estimating drug-polymer solubility either require fast dissolution in the polymeric matrix, rapid re-crystallization kinetics from supersaturated states or derive from regular solution theories. In this work, we present a new method for determining drug solubility, purely based on thermodynamic considerations, that uses only experimental data from DSC for calculations. The new thermodynamic model presented combines DSC analysis and application of Hessâs law to determine free energies of conversion of binary mixtures to amorphous solid dispersions, free energies of mixing as well as solubility as a function of temperature. The model drug indomethacin and polymers HPMCAS LF, PVP K29/32 and Eudragit EPO were used in these studies. Free energies were calculated as a function of temperature, for different drug-polymer compositions and the results show that HPMCAS LF solid dispersion with high drug content are less thermodynamically favorable compared to other polymer systems. Solubility of indomethacin in HPMCAS LF, PVP K29/32 and Eudragit EPO was 24, 55 and 56%  /w, respectively, at 25Â°C. The thermodynamic model presented has great advantages over traditional methods. It does not require estimation of any interaction parameters, it is almost assumption-free and uses only thermal data for calculations.']\n",

In this study, the relationship between the effect of the mucus layer on intestinal drug permeation and mucin distribution in different parts of the rat gastrointestinal tract was evaluated. The intestinal permeability of various lipophilic drugs in rat small intestine was evaluated using the   sac method. The expression profiles of mucin mRNA and proteins were evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR and western blotting, respectively. The intestinal permeability of griseofulvin and antipyrine was enhanced by dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment in the proximal small intestine, such as duodenum and jejunum, but not in the distal regions. The mRNA expression analysis of rat mucin genes revealed that the intestinal expression of Muc5ac was considerably higher in the duodenum, whereas that of Muc1, Muc2, and Muc3A was gradually increased toward the lower intestine. In addition, Muc5ac protein was detected only in the luminal fluids from the proximal small intestine after DTT treatment. Mucus limits the intestinal permeation of lipophilic drugs in the rat proximal small intestine, in which Muc5ac may be involved.'\n",

Dermatitis model was constructed by repeated topical application of oxazolone in wild-type, and P-gp and BCRP gene triple knockout ( ) mice to observe difference in phenotype. Target metabolome analysis of 583 metabolites was performed using skin and plasma. Dermatitis and scratching behavior in dermatitis model of   mice were more severe than wild-type mice, suggesting protective roles of these transporters. This hypothesis was supported by the metabolome analysis which revealed that concentration of histamine and other dermatitis-associated metabolites like urate and serotonin in the dermatitis skin, but not normal skin, of   mice was higher than that of wild-type mice. Gene expression of P-gp and BCRP was reduced in oxazolone-treated skin and the skin of patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis.

In this work, effects of MTX on the concentration of neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) and the role of FcRn in the interaction between MTX and adalimumab were investigated. The experiment was performed in rats whose FcRn had normal physiological function and also in rats whose FcRn was blocked with FcRn antibody. Rats were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.2 mg/kg MTX orally every week while taking one abdominal subcutaneous injection of 0.5 mg/kg adalimumab. The FcRn concentration in tissues and the PK parameters of adalimumab were compared between MTX-treated and placebo groups. In rats with normally functioning FcRn, the concentrations of FcRn were significantly increased in the liver (F=105.5,  =0.000) and kidney (F=996.312,  =0.000) after treatment with MTX, and the clearance (CL/F) of adalimumab was decreased accordingly (F=4.423,  =0.048). However, in rats injected with FcRn antibody, the concentrations of FcRn in MTX-treated rats were close to that of the placebo rats in the tissues of the liver (F=1.279,  =0.268) and kidney (F=0.661,  =0.424).

The  H NMR,  C NMR, FTIR and RP-HPLC were used to analyse the characteristics of the products and assess their purity. The toxicity of PAMAM-trastuzumab, PAMAM-doc-trastuzumab and PAMAM-ptx-trastuzumab conjugates was determined using MTT assay and compared with free trastuzumab, docetaxel and paclitaxel toward HER-2-positive (SKBR-3) and negative (MCF-7) human breast cancer cell lines. The cellular uptake and internal localisation were studied using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, respectively. The PAMAM-drug-trastuzumab conjugates in particular showed extremely high toxicity toward the HER-2-positive SKBR-3 cells and very low toxicity towards to HER-2-negative MCF-7 cells. As expected, the HER-2-positive SKBR-3 cell line accumulated trastuzumab from both conjugates rapidly; but surprisingly, although a large amount of PAMAM-ptx-trastuzumab conjugate was observed in the HER-2-negative MCF-7 cells. Confocal microscopy confirmed the intracellular localisation of analysed compounds. The key result of fluorescent imaging was the identification of strong selective binding of the PAMAM-doc-trastuzumab conjugate with HER-2-positive SKBR-3 cells only. Our results confirm the high selectivity of PAMAM-doc-trastuzumab and PAMAM-ptx-trastuzumab conjugates for HER-2-positive cells, and demonstrate the utility of trastuzumab as a targeting agent.

Here, a novel coupling of a nanoparticle (NP) kinetic model with a drug pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics model evaluates efficacy of cisplatin-loaded poly lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) NPs in heterogeneously vascularized tumor tissue. Tumor lesions are modeled with various levels of vascular heterogeneity, as would be encountered with different types of tumors. The magnitude of the extracellular to cytosolic NP transport is varied to assess tumor-dependent cellular uptake. NP aggregation is simulated to evaluate its effects on drug distribution and tumor response. Cisplatin-loaded PLGA NPs are most effective in decreasing tumor size in the case of high vascular-induced heterogeneity, a high NP cytosolic transfer coefficient, and no NP aggregation. Depending on the level of tissue heterogeneity, NP cytosolic transfer and drug half-life, NP aggregation yielding only extracellular drug release could be more effective than unaggregated NPs uptaken by cells and releasing drug both extra- and intra-cellularly. Model-based customization of PLGA NP and drug design parameters, including cellular uptake and aggregation, tailored to patient tumor tissue characteristics such as proportion of viable tissue and vascular heterogeneity, could help optimize the NP-mediated tumor drug response.'\n",
      " 'There is a plethora of studies on recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) application and delivery systems, but surprisingly few reports address the biophysical properties of the protein which are of crucial importance to develop effective delivery systems or to solve general problems related to rhBMP-2 production, purification, analysis and application. The solubility, stability and bioactivity of rhBMP-2 obtained by renaturation of   derived inclusion bodies was assessed at different pH and in different buffer systems using (dynamic) light scattering and thermal shift assays as well as intrinsic fluorescence measurements and luciferase based bioassays. rhBMP-2 is poorly soluble at physiological pH and higher. The presence of divalent anions further decreases the solubility even under acidic conditions. Thermal stability analyses revealed that rhBMP-2 precipitates are more stable compared to the soluble protein. Moreover, correctly folded rhBMP-2 is also bioactive as precipitated protein and precipitates readily dissolve under appropriate buffer conditions. Once properly formed rhBMP-2 also retains biological activity after temporary exposure to high concentrations of chaotropic denaturants. However, care should be taken to discriminate bioactive rhBMP-2 precipitates from misfolded rhBMP-2 aggregates, e.g. resolvability in MES buffer (pH\\xa05) and a discrete peak in thermoshift experiments are mandatory for correctly folded rhBMP-2. Our analysis revealed that   derived rhBMP-2 precipitates are not only bioactive but are also more stable compared to the soluble dimeric molecules. Knowledge about these unusual properties will be helpful to design improved delivery systems requiring lower amounts of rhBMP-2 in clinical applications.'\n",

Controlled-release poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) scaffolds were fabricated by E-jet 3D printing to deliver doxorubicin (DOX) and cisplatin (CDDP) simultaneously. This drug delivery system allowed the use of a reduced drug dosage resulting in a better effect on the human breast cancer cell apoptosis and inhibiting tumor growth, compared with the effect of each drug and the two drugs administrated without PLGA scaffolds. Our study suggested that DOX-CDDP-PLGA scaffolds could efficiently destroy MDA-MB-231 cells and restrain tumor growth. The 3D printed PLGA scaffolds with their time-programmed drug release might be useful as a new multi-drug delivery vehicle in cancer therapy, which has a potential advantage in a long term tumor cure and prevention of tumor recurrence.'\n",

ASDs with three different drug loadings, 10, 25 and 50\\xa0wt.%, and the commercially available tablets were exposed to acidic media (pH\\xa01.6), followed by transfer to, and dissolution in, intestinal media (pH\\xa06.5).

Different analytical methods, including nanoparticle tracking analysis, powder x-ray diffraction, second harmonic generation and two-photon excitation ultraviolet fluorescence microscopy, were used to characterize the phase behavior of these systems at different stages of dissolution. Results revealed that all ASDs exhibited some degree of drug release upon suspension in acidic media, and were also vulnerable to matrix crystallization. Upon transfer to intestinal media conditions, supersaturation was observed. This was short-lived for some dispersions due to the release of the crystals formed in the acid immersion stage which acted as seeds for crystal growth. Lower drug loading ASDs also exhibited transient formation of amorphous nanodroplets prior to crystallization. This work emphasizes the significance of assessing the impact of pH change on dissolution and provides a fundamental basis of understanding the phase behavior kinetics of ASDs of weakly basic drugs when formulated with pH sensitive polymers.'\n",

Thus, two typical pharmaceutical binders for direct compression (Parmcel 102 and TablettoseÂ® 80) were compared with two binders unsuitable for direct compression (CeolusÂ® KG1000 and GranuLacÂ® 200). The powders were characterized by helium pycnometry, laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and by determination of the powder flow. Furthermore, a novel technique to determine the occurrences of segregation within a tablet after manufacturing was introduced. For this purpose, a powder blend containing one spray-colored type of microcrystalline cellulose (VivapurÂ® 200) were prepared. It was shown that under application of externally applied lower punch vibration, the powder flow into the die increased and thus the die filling process was significantly improved. Hence, it was possible to manufacture tablets from powders, which are actually unsuitable for direct compression. In addition, the mechanical stability of the produced tablets was distinctly improved by application of lower punch vibration, whereby the occurrence of segregation was comparatively low. In summary, lower punch vibration allows a more efficient die filling, whereby the powder flow as well as mechanical stability of the tablets are improved.'\n",

The objective of this study was to assess the ability of PBPK model to predict plasma exposure of oxycodone, a widely used opioid for pain management, in adults and children. A full PBPK model of oxycodone following intravenous and oral administration was developed using a âbottom-upâ and âtop-downâ combined strategy. The model was then extrapolated to pediatrics through a reasonable scaling method. The adult and pediatric model was evaluated using data from 17 clinical PK studies by testing predicted/observed goodness of fit. The mean fold error for PK parameters was calculated. Finally, we used the validated PBPK model to visualize adult-children dose conversion for oxycodone. The developed PBPK model successfully predicted the oxycodone disposition in adults, wherein the predicted   observed AUC, C  and t  were within 0.90 to 1.20-fold difference. After scaling anatomy/physiology, protein binding, and clearance, the model showed satisfactory prediction performance for pediatric populations as predicted AUC were within the 1.50-fold range of the observed values. According to the application of PBPK model, we found that different intravenous doses should be given in children of different ages compared to a standard 0.1\\xa0mg/kg in adults, while a progressive increasing dose with age growth following oral administration is recommended for children. The current example provides the opportunity for using the PBPK model to guide dose adjustment of oxycodone in the design of future pediatric clinical studies.'\n",

The method validation evaluated assay characteristics including accuracy and precision, influence of sample processing on drug quantitation, whole blood matrix selectivity, dilution linearity and the stability of the drug in the study sample matrix. The method validation demonstrated acceptable analytical characteristics. The whole blood selectivity testing demonstrated accuracy between â4.8% and 13.9% in 10 out of 10 individual whole blood samples, suggesting that drug quantitation from whole blood is not impacted by the serial sampling procedure. Short-term and long-term drug stability in study sample matrix were established to cover required stability for sample storage and analysis (accuracy between â7.3% and 6.1%). We reported a successful validation of a bioanalytical method that quantifies PF-55781346 in samples collected via capillary microsampling. The experience shared in this study could serve as a model process for bioanalytical method validation when capillary microsampling is used.'\n",
      " 'There is ongoing concern regarding increased toxicity from paclitaxel in elderly patients, particularly of severe neutropenia. Yet, data so far is controversial and this concern is not supported by a clinically relevant age-dependent difference in pharmacokinetics (PK) of paclitaxel. This study assessed whether age is associated with increased risk for paclitaxel-induced neutropenia. Paclitaxel plasma concentration-time data, pooled from multiple different studies, was combined with available respective neutrophil count data during the first treatment cycle. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) data was modeled using a non-linear mixed effects approach and a semiphysiological neutropenia model, where systemic paclitaxel exposure was linked to reduced proliferation of neutrophils. The impact of age was evaluated on relevant variables in the model, using a significance threshold of  \\u2009<\\u20090.005. Paclitaxel PK-PD data was evaluated from 300 patients, with a median age of 65\\xa0years (range 23â84\\xa0years), containing 116 patients â¥70\\xa0years (39%). First cycle neutrophil counts were adequately described by a threshold effect model of paclitaxel on the proliferation rate of neutrophils. Age as a continuous or dichotomous variable (â¥70   <70\\xa0years) did not significantly impact sensitivity of the bone marrow to paclitaxel nor the average maturation time of neutrophils (both  \\u2009>\\u20090.005), causing a decline in the respective interindividual variability of <1%. Results from this large retrospective patient cohort do not suggest elderly patients to be at an increased risk of developing paclitaxel-associated neutropenia during the first treatment cycle. Reflexive dose reductions of paclitaxel in elderly patients are unlikely to improve the risk of severe neutropenia and may be deleterious.']\n"
