 . Our laboratory has previously prepared gelatin/methotrexate (MTX) conjugates containing mixed conjugation sites and by-product crosslinking, both of which may alter conjugate effectiveness. In this study, we prepared and evaluated gelatin/MTX conjugates having specific conjugate bond sites and minimal by-product crosslinking. 
 . Opposite polarity conjugates were produced by coupling gelatin having blocked amino groups with MTX (G-MTX) and by coupling MTX having blocked amino groups with gelatin (M-GEL) using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide HCl. Amino groups were blocked using citraconic anhydride and deblocked under acidic conditions. Gelatin and MTX contents were determined spectrophotometrically. The stability of each conjugate was determined by evaluating their   release of MTX in isotonic buffer at pH 7.4 and 37°C for 7 days. 
 . The G-MTX and M-GEL conjugates contained 21 and 1.2 mole MTX/mole gelatin and released 12 and 17% MTX by 7 days resulting in pseudo-first order release rate constants of 0.76×10  and 1.0×10  hr , respectively. Alternate MTX species (≤ 10%) were detected during the release study and were attributed to low molecular weight gelatin/MTX fragments and MTX polymers. 
 . Gelatin/MTX conjugates having opposite conjugate bond polarities and minimal by-product crosslinking have been produced and slowly released MTX by hydrolytic cleavage indicating good stability for future cell culture studies.",,,,2000

 . To study the miscibility of proteins and polymer excipients in frozen solutions and freeze-dried solids as protein formulation models. 
 . Thermal profiles of frozen solutions and freeze-dried solids containing various proteins (lysozyme, ovalbumin, BSA), nonionic polymers (Ficoll, polyvinylpyrrolidone [PVP]), and salts were analyzed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The polymer miscibility was determined from the glass transition temperature of maximally freeze-concentrated solute (T ′) and the glass transition temperature of freeze-dried solid (T ). 
 . Frozen Ficoll or PVP 40k solutions showed T ′ at −22°C, while protein solutions did not show an apparent T ′. All the protein and nonionic polymer combinations (5% w/w, each) were miscible in frozen solutions and presented single T ′s that rose with increases in the protein ratio. Various salts concentration-dependently lowered the single T ′s of the proteins and Ficoll combinations maintaining the mixed amorphous phase. In contrast, some salts induced the separation of the proteins and PVP combinations into protein-rich and PVP-rich phases among ice crystals. The T ′s of these polymer combinations were jump-shifted to PVP's intrinsic T ′ at certain salt concentrations. Freeze-dried solids showed varied polymer miscibilities identical to those in frozen solutions. 
 . Freeze-concentration separates some combinations of proteins and nonionic polymers into different amorphous phases in a frozen solution. Controlling the polymer miscibility is important in designing protein formulations.",,,,2000

 . The purpose of this work was to obtain a sterilized formulation consisting of biodegradable microspheres of poly (DL-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) for intraocular sustained release of ganciclovir. 
 . Microspheres were prepared using a dispersion of ganciclovir in fluorosilicone oil (FSiO) that was further dispersed in an acetone solution of PLGA [50/50 and inherent viscosity 0.41 dl/g], and emulsified in silicone oil with a surfactant. Once prepared, the formulation was exposed with an effective γ radiation dose of 2.5 megarads. The release rate data of ganciclovir from the sterilized and nonsterilized batches were compared using the similarity factor (f ). 
 . The dispersion of the drug in FSiO contributed to achieving a drug payload of up to 95% of the theoretical in the 300-500 μm microspheres. Ten mg released ganciclovir  at 1.3 μg/h for the first 21 days, but decreased to ∼ 0.2 μg/h from day 25 until the end of the release study (42 days). No significant differences in the amounts of encapsulated drug (α=0.05) were observed between the sterilized and nonsterilized microspheres. Furthermore, dissolution profiles of formulations behaved similarly before and after gamma radiation exposure. 
 . The technique of microsphere preparation described resulted in high ganciclovir loading (95%) and prolonged drug release. The ganciclovir formulation behaved similarly before and after the sterilization process.",,,,2000

 . To quantitatively compare   dissolution data in biorelevant and compendial media, to investigate whether   differences are reflected in the simulated plasma profile and to specify under which circumstances prediction of the plasma profile of orally administered lipophilic drugs can be achieved. 
 . Previously published dissolution data from seven products of four lipophilic drugs were compared using the first order model, the RRSBW distribution, and a model based on the Noyes-Whitney theory. Simulated plasma profiles were then obtained using a model-dependent approach. Simulated and observed plasma profiles were compared with the difference factor,  
 . 
 . No model consistently provided the best fit to the  data, which varied significantly with medium composition. Prediction of the plasma profile was possible (9.6 ≤  
 ≤ 34.2) in seven out of eleven cases. 
 . Although prediction of the plasma profile of lipophilic drugs solely on the basis of   data remains an ambitious target, this study shows that the plasma profile of a lipophilic drug can be predicted with appropriate   dissolution data, provided that the absolute bioavailability of the drug is known and the drug has dissolution limited absorption.",,,,2001

 . To establish a clear understanding of the role of biantennary branching glycans and genetic variants of α -acid glycoprotein (AGP) in enantioselective bindings of basic drug. 
 . Human native AGP was separated using concanavalin A affinity chromatography into two subfractions, the unretained fraction (UR-AGP, defect of biantennary glycan) and the retained fraction (R-AGP, possessing biantennary glycan(s)). Imminodiacetate-copper (II) affinity chromatography was used to separate human native AGP into A variant and a mixture of F1 and S variants (F1*S variants). The mixed solutions of the ( )- or ( )-isomer of the model drugs (15 μM disopyramide (DP) or 30 μM verapamil (VER)) and 40 μM of respective AGP species were subjected to high-performance frontal analysis/capillary electrophoresis (HPFA/CE) to determine the unbound drug concentrations. 
 . The unbound concentrations (Cu) of DP in UR-AGP solutions were lower than those in R-AGP solutions, whereas there was no significant difference in the enantiomeric ratios (Cu( )/Cu( )) of DP between UR- and R-AGP solutions. In case of genetic variant, the Cu( )/Cu( ) values of DP in F1*S and A solutions were 1.07 and 2.37, respectively. On the other hand, the enantiomeric ratio of VER in F1*S and A variant solutions were 0.900 and 0.871, respectively. 
 . The biantennary glycan structures are related to binding affinity of DP to AGP, but not responsible for the enantioselectivity. Genetic variants give significant effect on the enantioselectivity in DP binding, but not in VER binding.",,,,2001

 . To determine inter-lot and intra-subject variability in the bioavailability of the 100 mg extended phenytoin sodium capsules. In addition, to determine the effect of gender and menstrual cycle on phenytoin bioavailability. 
 . Three different lots of extended phenytoin sodium capsules were given to 12 healthy male and 12 healthy female subjects in a crossover fashion. One of the lots was also given a second time to each subject. Plasma phenytoin was determined, using an HPLC assay, in samples collected over a 73-hr period after each dose. 
 . The mean Cmax for the four administrations ranged from 1.71-1.79 μg/ml and mean AUC(0-∞) values from ranged 53.0-54.1 μg hr/ml. The elimination half-life was 3 hr shorter, and the AUC(0-∞) adjusted for the mg/kg dose was 30% lower for females. Average bioequivalence was demonstrated between the three lots for both Cmax and AUC(0-∞) based on the BE limit of 80-125%. Further, all confidence intervals of AUC(0-∞) fell within the limit of 90-111%. There were no differences in the confidence limits for Cmax and AUC(0-∞) determined separately for males and females. Also, there was no difference in the mean Cmax or AUC(0-∞) for females when analyzed as a function of the week of their menstrual cycle. Individual bioequivalence was demonstrated between three lots of phenytoin using the constant-scaled method, but not the reference-scaled method. 
 . There was very little difference in the bioavailability of the three lots of phenytoin. Females exhibited a lower AUC(0-∞) than males after adjustment of dose for body weight, but their inclusion in the study did not affect the assessment of bioequivalence. When dose was not adjusted for body weight, no difference in AUC(0-∞) was seen between males and females.",,,,2001

 . The partitioning of cetirizine in a phosphatidylcholine liposomes/water system was compared with that of hydroxyzine and acrivastine to gain insight into the mechanisms of interaction of its various electrical species with membranes. 
 . The lipophilicity profiles of the compounds were obtained from equilibrium dialysis and potentiometry, and compared with changes in NMR relaxation rates. 
 . The neutral form of hydroxyzine interacted mainly via hydrophobic interactions with the bilayer lipid core of the membrane, whereas for the cationic form both hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions were involved. Zwitterionic and anionic cetirizine were less lipophilic than its cation, which behaved like the corresponding species of hydroxyzine. Zwitterionic cetirizine interacted more by weak electrostatic interactions with the polar headgroups of phospholipids than by hydrophobic interactions with the membrane interior. The lipophilicity of its anion reflected the balance of repulsive electrostatic interactions between the carboxylate and phosphate groups and the hydrophobic interactions with the lipid core. 
 . The study confirms that various mechanisms influence the interaction of solutes with liposomes. Combining experimental techniques and using suitable reference compounds proves useful.",,,,2001

 . This work examines whether ion–pairing contributes to the apparent lipophilicity of cations, which is seen by a shake–flask or titrimetic method to be influenced by the nature and concentration of counter–ions. 
 . To solve this problem, the lipophilicity of several quaternary ammonium drugs was measured by cyclic voltammetry in the 1,2–dichloroethane/water system. The standard ionic partition coefficient values so obtained (log  ° 
 ) were correlated with log  
  values calculated by the CLOGP algorithm for the respective neutral molecules. 
 . The standard (i.e., intrinsic) lipophilicity values are shown to depend on a, the structure of the ion (nature, volume, charge), and b, on the Galvani potential difference at the ITIES (interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions). 
 . The standard lipophilicity values were not influenced by counter–ions. In contrast, simulations showed that the increased apparent lipophilicity of cations, as measured by the shake–flask method in the presence of lipophilic anions, is fully accounted for by the resulting increase in the Galvani potential difference.",,,,2001

 . To study the fracture behavior of the major habit faces of paracetamol single crystals using microindentation techniques and to correlate this with crystal structure and molecular packing. 
 . Vicker's microindentation techniques were used to measure the hardness and crack lengths. The development of all the major radial cracks was analyzed using the Laugier relationship and fracture toughness values evaluated. 
 . Paracetamol single crystals showed severe cracking and fracture around all Vicker's indentations with a limited zone of plastic deformation close to the indent. This is consistent with the material being a highly brittle solid that deforms principally by elastic deformation to fracture rather than by plastic flow. Fracture was associated predominantly with the (010) cleavage plane, but was also observed parallel to other lattice planes including (110), (210) and (100). The cleavage plane (010) had the lowest fracture toughness value, K  = 0.041MPa m , while the greatest value, K  = 0.105MPa m  was obtained for the (210) plane. 
 . Paracetamol crystals showed severe cracking and fracture because of the highly brittle nature of the material. The fracture behavior could be explained on the basis of the molecular packing arrangement and the calculated attachment energies across the fracture planes.",,,,2001

 . To investigate the possibility of modulating the compression shear strength of agglomerates by the incorporation of a solution binder and to study the subsequent effect on the deformation behavior and tablet forming ability of the agglomerates. 
 . Various concentrations (0.5 to 10%) of polyethylene glycol were incorporated as a solution binder into microcrystalline cellulose agglomerates of different porosity (10 and 20%) and the shear strength of the agglomerates, as evaluated by the 1/b value of the Kawakita equation, and the permeability to air and tensile strength of tablets formed from them were determined. 
 . Increased agglomerate porosity and concentration of polyethylene glycol reduced the 1/b values, which led to the formation of tablets with a lower permeability. A decreased tablet permeability corresponded to an increased tablet tensile strength except that the highest binder content was associated with a drop in the tablet tensile strength. 
 . The solution binder reduced the agglomerate shear strength, which was expressed as an increased degree of agglomerate deformation during compression. The latter seemed to be controlled by both agglomerate porosity and shear strength. The main role of the solution binder in improving the agglomerate compactability was to increase the degree of deformation of agglomerates during compression.",,,,2001

 . The acidic microclimate in poly(D, L-lactide-co-glycolide) 50/50 microspheres has been previously demonstrated by our group as the primary instability source of encapsulated bovine serum albumin (BSA). The objectives of this study were to stabilize the encapsulated model protein, BSA, and to achieve continuous protein release by using a blend of: slowly degrading poly(D, L-lactide) (PLA), to reduce the production of acidic species during BSA release; and pore-forming poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), to increase diffusion of BSA and polymer degradation products out of the polymer. 
 . Microspheres were formulated from blends of PLA (Mw 145,000) and PEG (Mw 10,000 or 35,000) by using an anhydrous oil-in-oil emulsion and solvent extraction (O/O) method. The polymer blend composition and phase miscibility were examined by FT-IR and DSC, respectively. Microsphere surface morphology, water uptake, and BSA release kinetics were also investigated. The stability of BSA encapsulated in microspheres was examined by losses in protein solubility, SDS-PAGE, IEF, CD, and fluorescence spectroscopy. 
 . PEG was successfully incorporated in PLA microspheres and shown to possess partial miscibility with PLA. A protein loading level of 5% (w/w) was attained in PLA/PEG microspheres with a mean diameter of approximately 100 μm. When PEG content was less than 20% in the blend, incomplete release of BSA was observed with the formation of insoluble, and primarily non-covalent aggregates. When 20%-30% PEG was incorporated in the blend formulation,   continuous protein release over 29 days was exhibited. Unreleased BSA in these formulations was water-soluble and structurally intact. 
 . Stabilization and controlled relaease of BSA from PLA/PEG microspheres was achieved due to low acid and high water content in the blend formulation.",,,,2001

 . The aim of this study was to obtain the resolution of flobufen enantiomers, an antiinflammatory active substance, by capillary electrophoresis with cyclodextrins. The mechanism of com- plexation and determination of the stoichiometry of the complexes were studied by NMR and the analytical method was developed and validated. 
 . Zone capillary electrophoresis coupled to direct ultraviolet detection was selected. The interaction between flobufen and the chiral selector was studied by NMR. Optimization of the separation was performed using a Box-Wilson Central Composite Design for three factors related to the composition of the electrolyte. 
 . Heptakis (2,3,6-tri- -methyl)-β-cyclodextrin (TM-β-CD) was found to be the most efficient selector via the formation of a 1:1 complex proved by NMR. Constants of complexation of flobufen enantiomers were determined by NMR and capillary electrophoresis. Optimal values for the critical factors of the analytical system were: pH (5.50), content in methanol (10% v/v), and TM-β-CD (30 mM). The ability of capillary electrophoresis to quantify as low as 0.1% (w/w) of   in  -flobufen or vice-versa was established. 
 . Capillary electrophoresis was shown to be a valuable method to control the enantiocomposition of flobufen by use of a chiral selector whose interactions with the analytes could be explored by NMR.",,,,2001

 . The pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetics of cisplatin (CDDP)-loaded polymeric micelles were examined to reveal their usefulness as a novel tumor-directed drug carrier system of CDDP. 
 . In biodistribution assay, free CDDP or CDDP-loaded micelles were administered intravenously to Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing mice. Antitumor activity and nephrotoxicity were respectively evaluated by the measurement of tumor size and plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN) after single bolus i.v. administration of each drug. 
 . The time profile of the plasma Pt level after the injection of the micelles exhibited a time-modulated disappearance as observed in saline  . The micelles exhibited 5.2- and 4.6-fold higher AUC of Pt in the plasma and tumor, respectively, with minimal change in the kidney, in comparison with free CDDP, suggesting that prolonged circulation of Pt in circulation and specific accumulation in the tumor were achieved utilizing the micellar drug carrier system. Administration of the micelles at the dose exhibiting antitumor activity similar to free CDDP did not increase the plasma BUN, whereas free CDDP induced its remarkable increase. 
 . CDDP-loaded micelles restrained nephrotoxicity, which is the dose-limiting factor of CDDP, while exhibiting tumor-specific accumulation. Thus, CDDP-loaded micelles are expected to be a novel formulation of CDDP for clinical use.",,,,2001

 . The purpose of this study was to determine the usefulness of transferrin (TF)-pendant-type polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-liposomes (TF-PEG-liposomes), in which TF was covalently linked to the distal terminal of PEG chains on the external surface of PEG-liposomes as a carrier for   cytoplasmic targeting to tumor cells. 
 . Small unilamellar TF-PEG-liposomes (100-140 nm in diameter) were prepared from DSPC, CH, DSPE-PEG, and DSPE-PEG-COOH (2:1:0.11:0.021, molar ratio), and were conjugated to TF via the carboxyl residue of DSPE-PEG-COOH. The intracellular targeting ability of TF-PEG-liposomes to tumor cells was examined   and in Colon 26 tumor-bearing mice. 
 . TF-PEG-liposomes, bearing approximately 25 TF molecules per liposome, readily bound to mouse Colon 26 cells   and were internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. TF-PEG-liposomes showed a prolonged residence time in the circulation and low RES uptake in Colon 26 tumor-bearing mice, resulting in enhanced extravasation of the liposomes into the solid tumor tissue. Electron microscopic studies in Colon 26 tumor-bearing mice revealed that the extravasated TF-PEG-liposomes were internalized into tumor cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. 
 . TF-PEG-liposomes had the capabilities of specific receptor binding and receptor-mediated endocytosis to target cells after extravasation into solid tumors  . Such liposomes should be useful for   cytoplasmic targeting of chemotherapeutic agents or plasmid DNAs to target cells.",,,,2001

 . A genetic neural network (GNN) model was developed to predict the phase behavior of microemulsion (ME), lamellar liquid crystal (LC), and coarse emulsion forming systems (W/O EM and O/W EM) depending on the content of separate components in the system and cosurfactant nature. 
 . Eight pseudoternary phase triangles, containing ethyl oleate as the oil component and a mixture of two nonionic surfactants and n-alcohol or 1,2-alkanediol as a cosurfactant, were constructed and used for training, testing, and validation purposes. A total of 21 molecular descriptors were calculated for each cosurfactant. A genetic algorithm was used to select important molecular descriptors, and a supervised artificial neural network with two hidden layers was used to correlate selected descriptors and the weight ratio of components in the system with the observed phase behavior. 
 . The results proved the dominant role of the chemical composition, hydrophile-lipophile balance, length of hydrocarbon chain, molecular volume, and hydrocarbon volume of cosurfactant. The best GNN model, with 14 inputs and two hidden layers with 14 and 9 neurons, predicted the phase behavior for a new set of cosurfactants with 82.2% accuracy for ME, 87.5% for LC, 83.3% for the O/W EM, and 91.5% for the W/O EM region. 
 . This type of methodology can be applied in the evaluation of the cosurfactants for pharmaceutical formulations to minimize experimental effort.",,,,2001

 . To develop the physiologically sound concept of fractal volume of drug distribution,  
 , and evaluate its utility and applicability in interspecies pharmacokinetic scaling. 
 . Estimates for  
  of various drugs in different species were obtained from the relationship:   where   is the total volume of the species (equivalent to its total mass assuming a uniform density 1g/mL),  
  is the plasma volume of the species and  
  is the conventional volume of drug distribution. This equation was also used to calculate the fractal analogs of various volume terms of drug distribution (the volume of central compartment,  
 , the steady state volume of distribution,  
 , and the volume of distribution following pseudodistribution equilibrium,  
 ). The calculated fractal volumes of drug distribution were correlated with body mass of different mammalian species and allometric exponents and coefficients were determined. 
 . The calculated values of  
  for selected drugs in humans provided meaningful and physiologically sound estimates for the distribution of drugs in the human body. For all fractal volume terms utilized, the allometric exponents were found to be either one or close to unity. The estimates of the allometric coefficients were found to be in the interval (0,1). These decimal values correspond to a fixed fraction of the fractal volume term relative to body mass in each one of the species. 
 . Fractal volumes of drug distribution scale proportionally to mass. This confirms the theoretically expected relationship between volume and mass in mammalian species.",,,,2001

 . To investigate new models characterizing dissolution data obtained for heterogenous materials (model I) and under randomly time-varying conditions (model II). 
 . In model I, the heterogeneity of the dissolving substance introduces variation of the fractional dissolution rate. In model II, the fractional dissolution rate evolves randomly, and thus the dissolution has the characteristics of a stochastic process. This situation is studied for the constant and time-dependent means of the dissolution rate. 
 . The time dynamics of the dissolved fraction is presented for model I. The standard characteristics of dissolution are derived under general conditions and for several examples. One of them is in accordance with a function found empirically (1). A duality between the time-dependency of the fractional dissolution rate and the heterogeneity of the substance is investigated. The mean and variance of the dissolved fraction are calculated for model II. A method for estimating the mean dissolution rate is proposed and illustrated using Monte-Carlo experiments. 
 . It follows from model I that the heterogeneity, with the same mean properties, slows down the dissolution with respect to the homogeneous case. The second approach permits predictions about the role of the stochastic fluctuations of the dissolution rate and to establish the boundaries for the dissolution profiles.",,,,2001

 . To utilize power spectral analysis (PSA) of heart rate variability (HRV) as a pharmacodynamic (PD) measure of atropine parasympathetic effect, and to model the kinetics of action. 
 . Heart rate data was collected following atropine administration to rats and was analyzed off-line for high frequency peaks by PSA of HRV as a measure of parasympathetic tone. A temporal cumulative approach (TCA) detected transient changes in parasympathetic activity. The pharmacokinetics (PK) was analyzed and linked to both direct and indirect PK-PD models. 
 . TCA enabled a quantitative measure of atropine parasympathetic activity. A simultaneous fit of the indirect PK-PD model to the experimental data of all three atropine doses successfully captured the experimental data. 
 . TCA can be used as a quantitative measure of parasympathetic tone. Our work has established a preclinical model to investigate the kinetics of drug action on the autonomic nervous system.",,,,2001

 . The purpose of this study was to determine the osmolality of sulfobutylether (SBE) and hydroxypropyl (HP) derivatives of cyclodextrins (CDs) via vapor pressure osmometry (VPO) and freezing point depression (FPD). (SBE) and HP-CDs are efficient excipients capable of solubilizing and stabilizing poorly water-soluble drugs in parenteral formulations. (SBE)-CDs have also been used as solubility enhancers and osmotic agents for the sustained release of poorly water-soluble drugs from osmotic pump tablets. The knowledge of the CD's osmolality in solution or inside such tablets would allow one to further characterize the release mechanisms. 
 . Experiments were conducted at 37°C with eight types of HP and (SBE)-CDs. The aqueous solutions ranged from 0.005-0.350 mol l 
 . Methods were developed to allow the measurement of high osmolalities using a vapor pressure osmometer or a differential scanning calorimeter. 
 . The osmolality calculations from the VPO and FPD measurements correlated well. The osmolality of (SBE)-CDs was significantly higher than the osmolality of HP-CDs and increased with the total degree of substitution (TDS). All CDs showed deviations from ideality at high concentrations. 
 . Empirical correlations of osmolality with concentration and TDS allowed the prediction of osmolality over a wide concentration range. This study also gave some useful insights into the behavior of CD derivatives in solution.",,,,2001

  This study was conducted to explore the role of the peripheral lymphatics in insulin absorption following subcutaneous (SC) administration using a sheep model that allows continuous collection of peripheral lymph and simultaneous assessment of systemic bioavailability. 
  In a parallel group design, soluble human insulin (0.5 IU/kg) was administered by bolus SC injection into the interdigital space of the hind leg of non-cannulated control sheep, and sheep in which the efferent popliteal lymph duct was cannulated. A separate group received a bolus IV injection (0.15 IU/kg). Blood was sampled from all animals, and lymph was collected continuously over 12 h post-dosing. Samples were assayed for insulin by ELISA. 
  The SC bioavailability of insulin in control sheep was 31.5 ± 3.2%, which was significantly higher than when the peripheral lymph was continuously collected (18.4 ± 1.7%). In the lymph-cannulated animals, 17.3 ± 1.0% of the dose was collected in peripheral lymph. 
  Based on the direct measurement of insulin in regional lymph and on the decrease in the systemic bioavailability when regional lymph was continuously collected, the results demonstrate that lymphatic absorption contributed significantly to the overall insulin bioavailability following SC administration to sheep.",,,,2001

 . Lipid-water partitioning of 187 pharmaceuticals has been assessed with solid-supported lipid membranes (TRANSIL) in microwell plates and with multilamellar liposomes for a data comparison. The high-throughput potential of the new approach was evaluated. 
 . Drugs were incubated at pH 7.4 with egg yolk lecithin membranes either on a solid support (TRANSIL beads) or in the form of multilamellar liposomes. Phase separation of lipid and water phase was achieved by ultracentrifugation in case of liposomes or by a short filtration step in case of solid-supported lipid membranes. 
 . Lipid-water partitioning data of both approaches correlate well without systematic deviations in the investigated lipophilicity range. The solid-supported lipid membrane approach provides high-precision data in an automated microwell-plate setup. The lipid composition of the solid-supported lipid membranes was varied to study the influence of membrane change on lipid-water partitioning. In addition, pH-dependent measurements have been performed with minimal experimental effort. 
 . Solid-supported lipid membranes represent a valuable tool to determine physiologically relevant lipid-water partitioning data of pharmaceuticals in an automated setup and is well suited for high-throughput data generation in lead optimization programs.",,,,2001

  To identify the slip system of L-lysine monohydrochloride dihydrate (LH) and to relate it to the deformation behavior under uniaxial compression. 
  The indentation hardness of the {100} face and the indentation moduli of the {100} and {011} faces of plate-shaped single crystals of LH (LHP) were determined using Knoop and Berkovich indenters, respectively. The deformation behavior during uniaxial compression was studied by the punch-stress vs. punch-displacement profile and by electron microscopy of the deformed crystals within cracked compacts. 
  The different indentation (elastic) moduli of the {100} and {011} faces of the crystals are consistent with the molecular packing density along these planes and suggest anisotropy. The existence of the {001} <100> slip system is proposed based on the pattern of changing indentation hardness with varying orientation of the Knoop indenter. A jagged uniaxial compression profile suggests deformation by mechanical twinning and not simple slip. The hypothesis of deformation by mechanical twinning is supported by the appearance of twin bands along the crystal faces as observed by electron microscopy of the cracked compacts. 
  During compression, most LHP crystals have their {100} faces oriented normal to, or inclined to, the compression axis, thereby facilitating plastic deformation along the {001} <100> slip system by mechanical twinning. Due to the low attachment energy between them, the {001} planes can also act as cleavage planes. This study demonstrates that knowledge of the crystal structure and slip systems can be used to model the tableting and compaction behavior of molecular crystals, such as LH.",,,,2002

  To derive a QSPR model for estimation of aqueous solubility of organic compounds. 
  Solubility data for 930 diverse compounds was investigated with principal component regression analysis. This set of compounds consists of pharmaceuticals, pollutants, nutrients, herbicides, and pesticides. The diversity of this collection was analyzed using MACCS fingerprint and BCUT chemistry space. 
  The training set of the solubility data is as diverse as the Available Chemicals Directory, and more diverse than the MDL Drug Data Report. Forty-six molecular descriptors were screened using a genetic algorithm. A QSPR model with a squared correlation coefficient (r ) of 0.92, a root mean square error of 0.53 log molar solubility (log S ), an average absolute estimation error of 0.36 log S , and a cross-validated q  of 0.91 was derived. The QSPR model was validated with a test set of 249 compounds not included in the training set. The absolute estimation error for the test set of compounds was 0.39 log S .

  The weak aqueous interaction between the protein lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the nonionic surfactant Tween 80 has been investigated, because weak protein-amphiphile interactions are of significant importance in pharmaceutical formulations, but are experimentally hard to determine. The system LDH/sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) was used as reference because SDS, by its strong protein binding, denatures LDH completely. 
  Fluorescence spectroscopy with pyrene and 1,3-bis(1-phenyl)propane (P3P) as probes, intrinsic protein fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy have been used. 
  The fluorescence probe pyrene monitors a weak Tween-LDH interaction, detectable below the critical micelle concentration of ordinary Tween micelles. The microviscosity probe P3P shows a surfactant-induced denaturation in the case of LDH/SDS but not in the case of LDH/Tween 80. Intrinsic LDH fluorescence verifies this behavior. Pulsed-gradient spin-echo NMR was also used to verify the weak LDH-Tween 80 interaction. 
  A weak interaction between LDH and Tween 80 occurs at hydrophobic zones of the protein, but it is not strong enough to denature LDH. The experimental outline used here provides a useful approach for mapping the very weak protein-amphiphile interactions often present in pharmaceutical formulations.",,,,2002

  To determine the effect of protein concentration on aggregation induced through quiescent shelf-life incubation or shipping-related agitation. 
  All aggregation was measured by size-exclusion high-performance liquid chromatography. Aggregation was induced by time-dependent incubation under stationary conditions or by agitation caused by shaking, vortexing, or vibration using simulated shipping conditions. 
  Protein aggregation is commonly a second- or higher-order process that is expected to increase with higher protein concentration. As expected, for three proteins (PEG-GCSF, PEG-MGDF, and OPG-Fc) that were examined, the aggregation increased with higher protein concentration if incubated in a quiescent shelf-life setting. However, aggregation decreased with higher protein concentration if induced by an air/water interface as a result of agitation. This unexpected result may be explained by the rate-limiting effect on aggregation of the air/water interface and the critical nature of the air/water interface to protein ratio that is greatest with decreased protein concentration. The non-ionic detergent polysorbate 20 enhanced the aggregation observed in the quiescently incubated sample but abrogated the aggregation induced by the air/water interface. 
  The effect of protein concentration was opposite for aggregation that resulted from quiescent shelf-life treatment compared to induction by agitation. For motionless shelf-life incubation, increased concentration of protein resulted in more aggregation. However, exposure to agitation resulted in more aggregation with decreased protein concentration. These results highlight an unexpected complexity of protein aggregation reactions.",,,,2002

  To determine the kinetics and mechanism of hydrolysis of efavirenz [(S)-6-chloro-4-(cyclopropylethynyl)-1,4-dihydro-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-3,1-benzoxazin-2-one] in aqueous solutions. 
  The solution stability was examined at 60°C and an ionic strength of 0.3 M over the pH range of 0.6 to 12.8. The loss of efavirenz and the appearance of degradants were followed with a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography assay. Characterization of the degradants was accomplished with liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 
  The degradation of efavirenz followed apparent first-order kinetics over the pH range of 0.6 to 12.8 at 60°C. The catalytic effect of phosphate and borate buffers was negligible while acetate and citrate demonstrated buffer catalysis. The overall rate constant indicated a pH minimum (the pH of maximum stability) of approximately 4. Mass spectra data identified a degradant with a molecular weight consistent with hydrolysis of the cyclic carbamate to the corresponding amino alcohol. The degradation route was confirmed with spiking experiments with an authentic sample of the amino alcohol indicating that the carbamate hydrolysis pathway was the predominant reaction throughout the pH range studied. Subsequent degradation of the amino alcohol proceeded at the extremes of the pH range studied via rearrangement to the quinoline. 
  The pH-rate profile was consistent with a combination of a V-shaped profile in the pH range of 0-9 and a sigmoid-shaped profile in the pH range of 4-13. The plateau that began at pH 10-11 is a result of the ionization of the amine of the carbamate inhibiting the base-catalyzed hydrolysis of efavirenz, given that the ionized form of the carbamate is resonance-stabilized toward hydroxide-catalyzed degradation. Thus, increasing the pH resulted in a parallel decrease in the unionized fraction and increase in hydroxide ion concentration resulting in a constant k  value.",,,,2002

  To characterize the electrochemical behavior of the photodegradation product of nifedipine, i.e., 2,6-dimethyl-4-(2-nitrosophenyl)-3,5-pyridine-carboxylic acid dimethyl ester (NPD) in different electrolytic media. We also evaluated the interaction between free radicals generated from NPD and xeno/endobiotics. 
  Tast polarography, differential pulse polarography, and cyclic voltammetry were used for the characterization. Controlled potential electrolysis and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy were used to generate and to detect the nitroso radical anion. 
  In protic media, the NPD derivative gave a reversible well-defined peak either on Hg or glassy carbon electrodes in a reaction involving two electrons and two protons to give the hydroxylamine derivative. In mixed aqueous-organic media (pH 9) and in aprotic media, nitroso radical anion was isolated and characterized, exhibiting second-order dimerization rate constant (k ) values of 11,300 ± 210 [Ms]  and 8,820 ± 78 [Ms] , respectively. Reactivity of the nitroso radical anion with relevant pharmacologic targets revealed a significant interaction with the tested endo/xenobiotics (cysteamine, GSH,  -acetylcysteine, and adenine). 
  Both in mixed and aprotic media, NPD generated free-radical species, the nitroso radical anion. Taking into account their respective interaction rate constants, the following tentative rank order of reactivity can be established as follows: cysteamine >  -acetylcysteine > GSH > adenine.",,,,2002

  Zn -INS was exposed to Cu /ascorbate-induced MCO. Products were analyzed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) and MS/MS, sodium dodecylsulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophotesis (SDS-PAGE), and CD spectroscopy. 
  A maximal loss of 40% INS was achieved when 20 μM INS/8.8μM Zn  were exposed to 8 μM Cu  and 50 μM ascorbate. MCO was completely inhibited by ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid or native catalase but not with a 1000-fold molar excess of Zn  over Cu . MCO did not alter the aggregation state of INS. High-performance liquid chromatography-fractionated products contained portions of oxidized and native INS monomers. Oxidation selectively targeted the B chain of INS, where MS/MS sequencing revealed 2-oxo-His formation at both His residues at a relative ratio of  His / His  = 2.8 ± 1.3 (SD). 
  At a Zn /INS molar ratio comparable to that in regular INS preparations, Zn -INS was susceptible to MCO. Both His residues of INS were converted partially to 2-oxo-His, with  His  possessing ca. three times greater susceptibility to MCO than  His .",,,,2002

  To predict the oxidative stability of a sulfonamide-containing 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone in lipid-based delivery systems,  -(3-{1[(3α,6R)-4-hydroxy-2-oxo-6-phenyl-6-propyltetrahydro-2H-pyran-3-yl]propyl}phenyl)-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinylsulfonamide (DHP) was oxidized by peroxides and peroxyl radicals in binary mixtures of water and organic cosolvents. 
  DHP was oxidized by hydrogen peroxide, t-butylhydroperoxide, or peroxyl radicals derived from the thermal decomposition of 2,2′-azobis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) in 40% (v/v) organic cosolvent and 5 mM buffer at or near 40°C. Interactions between DHP and ]propane sulfonic acid and imidazole) and DH  were assessed by  H-NMR spectroscopy. The formation of CO likely involves a free radical mechanism. 
  The reaction of DHP with peroxides in 40% (v/v) acetonitrile yields epimeric monohydroxylation products, R-OH and S-OH, at C-3 of the pyrone ring, and a keto-derivative (CO). Hydroxylation rates depend on the protonation state of DHP, and the nature of buffer and the organic cosolvent. Organonitriles accelerate the oxidation through formation of peroxycarboximidic acid. Peroxyl radicals do not yield significant amounts of R/S-OH or CO. 
  The hydrogen peroxide-induced degradation of DHP in the presence of acetonitrile involves two reactions, hydroxylation and carbonyl formatin. Hydroxylation proceeds via nucleophilic attack by the monodeprotonated form of DHP (DH ) on peroxycarboximidic acid. The oxidation rate is slowed by ion pairing between nitrogen-containing buffers ([3- -morpholino]propane sulfonic acid and imidazole) and DH . The formation of CO likely involves a free radical mechanism.",,,,2002

 . Mechanical properties of emulsions prepared by multi-inversion phase processes were investigated using a drop tensiometer. Based on the results obtained, a formulation process was developed and a new type of nanocarrier was prepared. These particulates were sized by photon correlation spectroscopy and were visualized by atomic force microscopy and transmission electronic microscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry was also performed. 
 . The marginally cohesive but stable interfacial properties of the initial system led to the formulation of lipidic nanocapsules that were composed of a liquid core surrounded by a cohesive interface and were dispersed in an aqueous medium. These related suspensions were stable upon dilution for several months. The control of the formulation parameters allowed an adjustment of the particle mean diameter in the range of 25-100 nm with a monodisperse size distribution.

 . The following nine different materials were tested: three lactoses, maltodextrin, two microcrystalline celluloses, sodium chloride, sucrose, and glass beads. Morphology, size, and size distribution, true density, bulk and tap density, angle of repose, flow index, and avalanching behavior were quantified for each excipient by scanning electron microscopy, laser time-of-flight analysis, helium pycnometer, graduated cylinder, fixed-height funnel, Flodex (Hanson Research Corp., Chatsworth, California) method, and AeroFlow (TSI, Inc., St. Paul, Minnesota), respectively. Environmental factors were controlled, and the avalanches were studied at various speeds. 
 . The strange-attractor graph obtained at 1 rotation per 120 s showed that it was difficult to appreciate the flowability differences among 3-mm glass beads, lactose 100, and lactose 325. However, plotting the raw data as a relationship of the time between each avalanche and the inverse of speed revealed a characteristic linear slope for each sample. Furthermore, a new flowability index based on the SD calculated from the raw data gave results that were consistent with Carr's index. A cohesive index also can be determined by avalanche behavior, and it reflects the stability of the rapid particular rearrangements of powder.

 . Rapid cooling (20°C/min) inhibited mannitol crystallization, whereas at slower cooling rates (10°C and 5°C/min) partial crystallization was observed. The amorphous freeze-concentrate was characterized by two glass transitions at -32°C and -25°C. When the frozen solutions were heated past the two glass transition temperatures, the solute crystallized as mannitol hydrate. An increase in the concentration of PVP increased the induction time for the crystallization of mannitol hydrate. At concentrations of ≥100 mM, the buffer salts significantly inhibited mannitol crystallization.

 . X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) were used to study frozen aqueous solutions of mannitol with or without trehalose. By attaching a vacuum pump to the low-temperature stage of the diffractometer, it was possible to simulate the freeze-drying process   in the sample chamber of the XRD. This enabled real-time monitoring of the solid state of the solutes during the process. 
 . In rapidly cooled aqueous solutions containing only mannitol (10% w/w), the solute was retained amorphous. Annealing of frozen solutions or primary drying, both below  g′, resulted in crystallization of mannitol hydrate. Similar effects were observed in the presence of trehalose (2% w/w). At higher concentrations (≥5% w/w) of this noncrystallizing sugar, annealing below  g′ led to nucleation but not crystallization. However, during primary drying, crystallization of mannitol hydrate was observed.

  Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified gelatin was synthesized by reacting Type-B gelatin with PEG-epoxide. The nanoparticles, prepared by pH and temperature controlled ethanol-water solvent displacement technique, were characterized for mean size, size distribution, and surface morphology. Electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) was used to confirm the surface presence of PEG chains.   release of tetramethylrhodamine-labeled dextran (TMR-dextran, Mol. wt. 10,000 daltons) from the nanoparticle formulations was examined in PBS, with and without 0.2-mg/ml protease, at 37°C. Relative cytotoxicity profile of control and PEGylated gelatin was evaluated in BT-20 a human breast cancer cell line. The nanoparticles were incubated with BT-20 cells to determine uptake and cellular distribution using confocal microscopy. 
  Gelatin and PEGylated gelatin nanoparticles were found to be spherical in shape with a smooth surface in a size range of 200-500 nm and a unimodal size distribution. ESCA results showed an increase in the ether carbon (-C-O-) peak in the PEGylated gelatin nanoparticles due to the presence of PEG chains. The presence of PEG chains decreased the percent release of TMR-dextran in the presence of proteolytic enzyme due to steric repulsion. Cytotoxicity assays indicated that both gelatin and PEGylated gelatin were completely non-toxic to the cells. A large fraction of the administered control gelatin and PEGylated gelatin nanoparticles were found to be concentrated in the perinuclear region of the BT-20 cells after 12 hours indicating possible vesicular transport through initial uptake by endocytosis and endosomal processing.

  TNF-α concentrations were determined with the aid of ELISA kits. Chemical stabilities of the compounds were determined in three phosphate buffer solutions (pH 6, 6.4, and 7.4) at 25 and 32°C by high-pressure liquid chromatography, and half-lives were calculated. 
  The addition of  -alkyl groups to the glutarimide ring of the thalidomide molecule had little effect on the ability such compounds have to inhibit TNF-α production. There was no statistical difference between the activity of thalidomide and its  -alkyl analogs at a 95% confidence level. Like thalidomide, the  -alkyl analogs in this series inhibit an average of 60% of the TNF-α synthesis in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures. Thalidomide and its  -alkyl analogs are hydrolyzed at very similar rates, with half-lives ranging from 25 to 35 h at 32°C at pH 6.4 and an average rate constant of 2.35 × 10 /h.

  Quantification of the pro-inflammatory action of mitogens on mRNA levels of growth-related genes, transcription factors, and cytokines in T cells as markers for the screening of compounds with immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory or cytotoxic potential. 
  A reverse transcription-real time-polymerase chain reaction assay with TaqMan probes was developed. Jurkat T cells were treated with cyclosporin A, hypericin, capsaicin, and catechin before phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate stimulation, and their effects on the relative mRNA levels were determined. A cell viability assay was performed in parallel. 
  Cyclosporin A and capsaicin were potent inhibitors of PMA-induced cytokine transcription. Cyclosporin A further targeted cyclin D1 transcription. Capsaicin exhibited no effects on the cell viability at low concentrations, whereas cyclosporin A did. Hypericin down-regulated nearly all investigated mRNAs, resulting in a strong time-dependent cytotoxicity. Catechin showed no effects on mRNA levels and cell viability. 
  The inhibition of the up-regulation of mRNA levels of cytokines points to a specific anti-inflammatory potential of capsaicin. Hypericin showed no specific effects on the mRNA expression. The overall decrease of mRNA levels is probably an early indication of the strong cytotoxic effect observed after 48 h. Therefore, quantification of mRNA levels by reverse transcription-real time-polymerase chain reaction is, in combination with the monitoring of cell viability, a valuable tool to distinguish between specific immunomodulatory and cytotoxic effects  .",,,,2002

  Resveratrol, a phenolic phytoalexin occurring in grapes, wine, peanuts, and cranberries, has been reported to have anticarcinogenic, antioxidative, phytoestrogenic, and cardioprotective activities. Because little is known about the metabolism of this potentially important compound, the   and   metabolism of  -resveratrol were investigated. 
  The   experiments included incubation with human liver microsomes, human hepatocytes, and rat hepatocytes and the   studies included oral or intraperitoneal administration of resveratrol to rats and mice. Methanol extracts of rat urine, mouse serum, human hepatocytes, rat hepatocytes, and human liver microsomes were analyzed for resveratrol metabolites using reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with on-line ultraviolet-photodiode array detection and mass spectrometric detection (LC-DAD-MS and LC-UV-MS-MS). UV-photodiode array analysis facilitated the identification of  - and  -isomers of resveratrol and its metabolites. Negative ion electrospray mass spectrometric analysis provided molecular weight confirmation of resveratrol metabolites and tandem mass spectrometry allowed structural information to be obtained. 
  No resveratrol metabolites were detected in the microsomal incubations, and no phase I metabolites, such as oxidations, reductions, or hydrolyzes, were observed in any samples. However, abundant  -resveratrol-3- -glucuronide and  -resveratrol-3-sulfate were identified in rat urine, mouse serum, and incubations with rat and human hepatocytes. Incubation with β-glucuronidase and sulfatase to release free resveratrol was used to confirm the structures of these conjugates. Only trace amounts of cis-resveratrol were detected, indicating that isomerization was not an important factor in the metabolism and elimination of resveratrol. 
  Our results indicate that  -resveratrol-3- -glucuronide and  -resveratrol-3-sulfate are the most abundant metabolites of resveratrol. Virtually no unconjugated resveratrol was detected in urine or serum samples, which might have implications regarding the significance of   studies that used only unconjugated resveratrol.",,,,2002

  Sterically stabilized phospholipid micelles (SSMs) composed of poly(ethylene glycol-2000)-grafted distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (PEG(2000)-DSPE) are new and promising lipid-based carriers for water-insoluble drugs. This study investigates and compares sterically stabilized mixed micelles (SSMM), composed of (PEG(2000)-DSPE) plus egg-phosphatidylcholine, with SSM as a novel delivery system for improved solubilization of water-insoluble drugs using paclitaxel as a model. 
  Paclitaxel was solubilized in SSM (P-SSM) and SSMM (P-SSMM) by coprecipitation and rehydration with isotonic 0.01M HEPES buffer, pH 7.4. After separation of excess drug by centrifugation, mean particle size and morphology of particles in the supernatant were determined by quasi-elastic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. The solubilization potentials of SSMM and SSM for paclitaxel were determined by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Cytotoxic activity of paclitaxel in SSMM, SSM, and dimethyl sulfoxide (10% DMSO) was determined against human breast cancer cells (MCF-7). 
  Mean hydrodynamic diameter of P-SSMM and P-SSM were 13.1 ± 1.1 nm and 15 ± 1 nm (n = 3), respectively. SSMM solubilized 1.5 times more paclitaxel than SSM for the same total lipid concentration. Solubilized paclitaxel amount increased linearly with an increase in lipid concentration. A therapeutically relevant lipid concentration (15 mM) of SSMM solubilized 1321 ± 48μg/ml of paclitaxel. Paclitaxel in the absence of sufficient SSM aggregated to form lipid-coated crystals. P-SSMM, P-SSM, and paclitaxel in DMSO had comparable cytotoxic activities against MCF-7 cells.

  protein release from methacrylated hydrogels was influenced by factors such as the drug loading procedure and the molecular weight and loading concentration of the proteins. The feed composition and degree of substitution of inulin seem to be crucial in controlling both the extent and the rate of release. Protein release was clearly enhanced in the presence of inulinase, indicating the biodegradable properties of methacrylated inulin hydrogels.

  Use a microcalorimetric technique to measure the interactions between water vapor and amorphous pharmaceutical solids and describe the relationship between long-term physical stability and the storage relative humidity (RH) at constant temperature. 
  A thermal activity monitor was used to characterize interactions of water vapor with spray-dried amorphous sucrose, lactose, raffinose, and sodium indomethacin. Differential scanning calorimetry was used to measure glass transition temperature,  
 . X-ray powder diffraction was used to confirm that the spray-dried samples were amorphous. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine particle morphology. Specific surface area was determined by BET analysis of nitrogen and krypton adsorption isotherms. 
  The moisture-induced thermal activity traces (MITATs) of the materials in this study exhibit general behavior that helps explain the effect of moisture content on the physical stability of the glassy phase at a given storage temperature. At some RH threshold,  
 , the MITAT exhibits a dramatic increase in the energy of interaction between water vapor and the glass that cannot be explained by a phase or morphology change. Calorimetric data indicate that water vapor-solid interactions are reversible below  
 ; above  
 , energetic hysteresis is observed and water-water interactions predominate. In addition, the MITAT was deconvoluted into sorptive and nonsorptive components, making it possible to assign the observed heat flow to unique thermal events. Samples stored at a RH just below  
  for more than 2 months show no evidence of morphology or phase change. In addition, the MITAT can be deconvoluted into sorptive and nonsorptive components by using a twin-calorimeter arrangement. This analysis provides specificity to the microcalorimetric analysis and helps explain the nature of the physical changes that occur during the hydration glassy phase. 
  The MITAT is a useful tool to determine the onset of moisture-induced physical instability of glassy pharmaceuticals and may find a broad application to determine appropriate storage conditions to ensure long-term physical stability.",,,,2003

  The sodium-dependent, purine-selective nucleoside transporter, SPNT, has a unique steady-state expression pattern in renal epithelial cells. In comparison with the concentrative nucleoside transporter, CNT1, which is confined to the apical membrane, SPNT is expressed predominantly on the apical membrane but with significant expression on the basolateral membrane as well. Alternate surface expression indicates that SPNT likely has different sorting and trafficking mechanisms from CNT1. Because glycosylation has been reported to be essential for apical targeting of other transporters, and SPNT contains three unique glycosylation sites, we examined the importance of glycosylation in sorting of SPNT. Preliminary studies suggested that glycosylation affects surface expression of SPNT but not CNT1. 
  All three unique glycosylation sites were mutated alone and in tandem. Wild-type and mutant SPNT, tagged with green fluorescence protein, were stably transfected into MDCK. Positive clones were assayed for polarized surface expression by immunofluorescence and functional analysis. 
  Mutation at all three sites alone or in tandem resulted in functional proteins. Removal of sites N606 and N625 resulted in proteins of reduced molecular mass. None of the unglycosylated mutants localized differently than wild-type SPNT. 
  N-linked glycosylation is not essential for polarized sorting.",,,,2003

  The mRNA levels of MDR1 (P-glycoprotein), multidrug resistance-associated proteins (MRP1, MRP2), cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and villin in human colorectal cell lines (HCT-15, LoVo, DLD-1, HCT-116 and SW620) were quantitatively compared with those in Caco-2 cells. 
  The mRNA levels were determined by real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and expressed as the relative concentrations of MDR1 mRNA to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA. 
  MDR1 mRNA was expressed in HCT-15 LoVo and DLD-1 cells at similar or lower level to Caco-2. The expression of MRP1 mRNA in the cell lines tested was comparable with Caco-2. MRP2 mRNA was detected only in HCT-116 and SW620 at significantly lower level than Caco-2. CYP3A mRNA was detected in HCT-15, LoVo, DLD-1 and SW620 at similar level to Caco-2. 
  HCT-15 LoVo and DLD-1 cells express proteins important for regulating the intestinal absorption of drugs, i.e., MDR1, MRP1 and CYP3A, whereas HCT-116 and SW620 cells were not acceptable for evaluation of absorption properties of drug candidates.",,,,2003

  The present study has undertaken the liver- and lobe-selective nonviral gene transfer following the instillation of naked plasmid DNA (pDNA) using catheter on the liver surface in mice. 
  The polyethernylon catheter was inserted intraperitoneally through the abdominal wall and was retained on the surface of the liver right and left medial lobes. pDNA was administered through the catheter to the liver right and left medial lobes. 
  The luciferase levels produced in the applied liver lobes at 6 h after liver surface instillation of pDNA were significantly higher than those produced in other liver lobes and other tissues assayed, and ranged from approximately 5 folds higher in other lobes to 20-30 folds higher in other tissues. Following liver surface instillation of pDNA at a time from 2 to 24 h or at a volume from 15 to 60 μl, the gene expressions of the applied liver lobes were always significantly higher than those of other liver lobes and other tissues.

 . The purpose of this work was to image crystalline drug nanoparticles from a liquid dispersion and in a solid dosage form for the determination of size, shape, and distribution. 
 . Crystalline drug nanoparticles were adsorbed from a colloidal dispersion on glass for atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. Nanoparticles that were spray coated onto a host bead were exposed by ultramicrotomy for scanning electron microscopy and AFM examination. 
 . The adsorbed drug nanoparticles were measured by AFM to have a mean diameter of 95 nm and an average aspect ratio of 1.3. Nanoparticles observed in the solid dosage form had a size and shape similar to drug nanoparticles in the dispersion. Particle size distribution from AFM measurement agreed well with data from field emission scanning electron microscopy, static light scattering, and X-ray powder diffraction. 
 . AFM is demonstrated to be a valuable tool in visualization and quantification of drug nanoparticle crystals in formulations. In addition to accurate size measurement, AFM readily provides shape and structural information of nanoparticles, which cannot be obtained by light scattering.

 . The purpose of this work was to investigate spray-freezing into liquid (SFL) and atmospheric freeze-drying (ATMFD) as industrial processes for producing micronized SFL powders with enhanced aqueous dissolution. Micronized SFL powders dried by ATMFD were compared with vacuum freeze-dried SFL powders. 
 . Danazol was formulated with polyvinyl alcohol (MW 22,000), polyvinylpyrrolidone K-15, and poloxamer 407 to produce micronized SFL powders that were freeze-dried under vacuum or dried by ATMFD. The powders were characterized using Karl-Fischer titration, gas chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, surface area, and dissolution testing (SLS 0.75%/Tris 1.21% buffer media). 
 . Micronized SFL powders containing amorphous drug were successfully dried using the ATMFD process. Micronized SFL powders contained less than 5% w/w and 50 ppm of residual water and organic solvent, respectively, which were similar to those contents detected in a co-ground physical mixture of similar composition. Micronized SFL powders dried by ATMFD had lower surface areas than powders produced by vacuum freeze-drying (5.7 vs. 8.9 m /g) but significantly greater surface areas than the micronized bulk drug (0.5 m /g) and co-ground physical mixture (1.9 m /g). Rapid wetting and dissolution occurred when the SFL powders were introduced into the dissolution media. By 5 min, 100% dissolution of danazol from the ATMFD-micronized SFL powder had occurred, which was similar to the dissolution profile of the vacuum freeze-dried SFL powder. 
 . Vacuum freeze-drying is not a preferred technique in the pharmaceutical industry because of scalability and high-cost concerns. The ATMFD process enables commercialization of the SFL particle-engineering technology as a micronization method to enhance dissolution of hydrophobic drugs.",,,,2003

 . The purpose of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to monitor the freeze-drying process  . 
 . The experiment was performed in a pilot-scale freeze-dryer, in which the NIRS probe was interfaced using a lead-through to the lyophilizer. Special equipment for the sample presentation was developed. NIRS measurements were made using a FT (Fourier transform)-NIR spectrometer fitted with a single fiber reflectance probe. 
 . The physical changes, that is, freezing, sublimation, and desorption, generated significant spectral changes. There was good agreement between NIRS monitoring and product temperature monitoring about the freezing process and the transition from frozen solution to ice-free material. The NIRS monitoring also provided new information about the process that was not possible to detect with product temperature monitoring, such as the rate of the desorption process and the steady-state where the drying was complete. The NIRS monitoring yields significantly more information about the actual process and essentially explains the observed changes of the product temperature during the lyophilization process. 
 . NIRS monitoring is a viable tool for   monitoring, both qualitatively and quantitatively. It can facilitate investigations of the drying process within a sample. The small volume monitored makes sample presentation very important.",,,,2003

Powder samples of crystalline ibuprofen, spray-dried salbutamol sulphate, spray-dried and crystalline trehalose, and two polymorphic forms of indometacin were studied using differential scanning calorimetry as a supportive technique as appropriate. 
 . The ibuprofen showed a probe position discontinuity corresponding to the melting point of the material. Spray-dried salbutamol sulphate showed a discontinuity corresponding to decomposition but not to the glass transition, whereas both crystalline and amorphous trehalose showed a single discontinuity corresponding to physical collapse of the material. Studies using the α and γ forms of indometacin showed that the technique was able to distinguish between the two polymorphic forms.

 . The raw adhesion force data for the micronized and SEDS™ material were 14.1 nN (SD 2.5 nN) and 4.2 nN (SD 0.8 nN), respectively. After correction for contact area, the forces per unit area were 13 mN/μm  (SD 2.3 mN/μm ) and 3 mN/μm  (SD 0.6 mN/μm ). The average work of adhesion was calculated using the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts theory and was found to be 19 mJm  (SD 3.4 mJm ) for the micronized particle and 4 mJm  (SD 0.8 mJm ) for the SEDS™ particle. 
 . It is possible to produce a three-dimensional representation of the contact area involved in the interaction and make quantitative comparisons between different particles.

 . As an effect of their plastic deformation behavior, ductile materials create a large surface for bonding during compaction. However, a serious drawback is their high lubricant sensitivity, preventing the formation of strong bonds. The purpose of this study was both an increase in compactibility and a reduction of the lubricant sensitivity of ductile filler-binders by using hollow particles. This was illustrated for inulin. 
 . Both solid and hollow inulin particles were prepared by spray-drying. Unlubricated tablets and tablets containing 0.5% magnesium stearate were compressed in a compaction simulator, operating at 300 mm/s. The tablet crushing strength was determined with a Schleuniger apparatus. 
 . The compaction of unlubricated, solid inulin particles showed that the product had good compatibility. This was caused by plastic deformation of the ductile, amorphous material under load, creating a large surface for bonding. After lubrication, however, the bonding properties decreased significantly, which was caused by the presence of a lubricant film. Hollow inulin particles have an increased compactibility as compared with solid particles and a strongly reduced lubricant sensitivity. Scanning electron micrographs show that hollow particles fragment before they start plastic deformation. This fragmentation behavior is supported by tablet surface area measurements and calculation of the buckling strength. This effect was responsible for both a higher crushing strength and a lower lubricant sensitivity as compared with solid inulin particles. 
 . Compactibility of inulin particles can be increased, and lubricant sensitivity can be decreased by using hollow instead of solid particles.",,,,2003

  To investigate whether high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) treatment allows the sterilization of thermosensitive polymer nanoparticle suspensions without jeopardizing their physicochemical integrity. 
  Application of HHP was explored on a wide variety of thermosensitive poly(cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles, varying by their type (nanospheres or nanocapsules), by their preparation method (nanoprecipitation or emulsion/solvent evaporation), as well as by their surface characteristics. Physicochemical characterization before and after pressurization included turbidimetry, size measurement, zeta potential, scanning electron microscopy and infrared analysis. A sterility test also conducted according to pharmacopoeial requirements on an importantly contaminated nanoparticle suspension. 
  Poly(cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles appeared to be extremely baroresistant. Continuous or oscillatory HHP treatment up to 500 MPa during 30 min induced generally neither physical, nor chemical damage. However, precautions should be taken when surface modifiers are adsorbed onto nanoparticles, as a layer destabilization may occur. Finally, this process allowed the successful inactivation of vegetative bacteria, yeast, and fungi.

  The validity of using chloramine-T as a model compound for mimicing oxidative stress was examined using human serum albumin (HSA) as a model. Important sites of oxidation were studied by mild treatment with chloramine-T and by mutating  Cys for a serine (C34S). 
  High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with fluorescence detection to confirm the validity of chloramine-T as an oxidizing agent was used. Oxidized amino acid residues were detected by reaction with 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitro benzoic acid), digestion with cyanogen bromide, followed by capillary electrophoresis. Protein conformation was examined by spectroscopic techniques. 
  From the HPLC analysis of human serum, the validity of using chloramine-T as an oxidizing agent was confirmed. At low chloramine-T concentrations (CT -HSA, CT -HSA),  Cys and Met residues were oxidized, at medium concentrations (CT -HSA), the tryptophan residue also appeared to be oxidized, and at the highest concentration (CT -HSA), the net charge of Site II of HSA was found to be more negative. The two highest levels of oxidation of HSA (CT -HSA, CT -HSA) resulted in conformational changes with an increased exposure of hydrophobic regions, decreased high-affinity bindings of warfarin and ketoprofen and a reduced esterase-like activity. The latter protein also has a shorter plasma half-life and an increased liver clearance. 
  We succeeded in imitating oxidative damage to HSA using chloramine-T and the findings show that Site II is more affected than Site I and  Cys, when HSA is exposed to oxidative stress.",,,,2003

  This study was designed to investigate the stability of recombinant FVIII (rFVIII) in solution at different pHs and to probe the cause(s) of rFVIII inactivation under accelerated storage conditions. 
  Aqueous stability samples of full-length rFVIII at different pHs were incubated at 40°C for several days and analyzed by the one-stage clotting assay, SEC-HPLC, SDS-PAGE, and UV spectrophotometry. 
  Incubation of liquid rFVIII at 40°C inactivated the protein rapidly and linearly with time on a semi-log scale at all pHs, suggesting a first order or pseudo first order process. A U-shaped relationship was found between the rate constant for loss of rFVIII activity and the solution pH. The minimal rate of inactivation was found between pH 6.6 and 7.0 with a half-life of approximately 4 days. The SEC-HPLC results indicated pH-dependent aggregation of rFVIII during incubation. It was found that the disappearance of monomeric rFVIII by SEC-HPLC correlated with the loss of rFVIII activity (r  = 0.97). Both the SDS-PAGE and UV results confirmed the aggregation pathway of rFVIII. In addition, the SDS-PAGE results suggest involvement of three aggregation mechanisms - disulfide-bond formation/exchange, non-reducible crosslinking, and physical interactions. 
  The full-length rFVIII is unstable in solution at 40°C and loses activity rapidly through a first order or pseudo first order aggregation process, which consists of both physical and chemical pathways. SEC-HPLC may be used in monitoring rFVIII stability studies in lieu of the clotting assay under the incubation conditions used in this study.",,,,2003

  The purpose of this work was to 1) investigate the effect of sucrose esters (sucrose oleate and sucrose laureate in water or in Transcutol®, TC) on the stratum corneum (SC) barrier properties   and 2) examine the impact of these surfactant-like molecules on the   percutaneous penetration of a model penetrant 4-hydroxybenzonitrile (4-HB). 
  Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy and transepidermal water loss measurements were used to evaluate the sucrose oleate- and sucrose laureate-induced biophysical changes in SC barrier function  . In addition, the effect of the enhancers on 4-HB penetration was monitored   using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy in conjunction with tape-stripping of the treated site. 
  Treatment of the skin with 2% sucrose laureate or sucrose oleate in TC significantly increased the extent of 4-HB penetration relative to the control. Furthermore, when skin treated with these formulations was examined spectroscopically, the C-H asymmetric and symmetric stretching bands of the lipid methylene groups were characterized by 1) decreased absorbances and 2) frequency shifts to higher wavenumbers. These effects on the SC lipids and 4-HB penetration were more pronounced for sucrose laureate when combined with TC. 
  A combination of sucrose esters (oleate or laureate) and TC is able to temporally alter the stratum corneum barrier properties, thereby promoting 4-HB penetration.

  Recently, colloidal dispersions made of mixtures from solid and liquid lipids have been described to combine controlled-release characteristics with higher drug-loading capacities than solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs). It has been proposed that these nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) are composed of oily droplets that are embedded in a solid lipid matrix. The present work investigates the structure and performance of NLCs. 
  Colloidal lipid dispersions were produced by high-pressure homogenization and characterized by laser diffraction, photon correlation spectroscopy, wide-angle x-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electron spin resonance experiments were performed to investigate the mobility of the components and the molecular environment of model drugs. Furthermore, a nitroxide reduction assay with ascorbic acid was conducted to explore the accessibility of the lipid model drug from the outer aqueous phase. 
  Proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra clearly demonstrate that NLC nanoparticles differ from nanoemulsions and from SLNs by forming a liquid compartment that is in strong interaction to the solid lipid. The electron spin resonance model drug was found to be accommodated either on the particle surface with close water contact (SLN) or additionally in the oil (NLC). The oil compartment must be localized on the particle surface, because it can be easily reached by ascorbic acid. 
  Neither SLN nor NLC lipid nanoparticles showed any advantage with respect to incorporation rate or retarded accessibility to the drug compared with conventional nanoemulsions. The experimental data let us conclude that NLCs are not spherical solid lipid particles with embedded liquid droplets, but they are rather solid platelets with oil present between the solid platelet and the surfactant layer.",,,,2003

  The aim of the present study was to develop a new type of core-shell nanoparticles from a family of novel amphiphilic copolymers, based on dextran (DEX) grafted with poly(ε–caprolactone) (PCL) side chains (PCL-DEX). 
  A family of PCL-DEX copolymers was synthesized in which both the molecular weight and the proportion by weight of DEX in the copolymer were varied. The nanoparticles were prepared by a technique derived from emulsion-solvent evaporation, during which emulsion stability was investigated using a Turbiscan. The nanoparticle size distribution, density, zeta potential, morphology, and suitability for freeze-drying were determined. 
  Because of their strongly amphiphilic properties, the PCL-DEX copolymers were able to stabilize o/w emulsions without the need of additional surfactants. Nanoparticles with a controlled mean diameter ranging from 100 to 250 nm were successfully prepared. A mechanism of formation of these nanoparticles was proposed. Zeta potential measurements confirmed the presence of a DEX coating.

  Racemic valnoctamide (VCD) is a central nervous system- active drug commercially available in Europe. VCD possesses two chiral centers and, therefore, it exists as a mixture of four stereoisomers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the anticonvulsant activity of two VCD stereoisomers in comparison with VCD (racemate), valpromide (VPD), and valproic acid (VPA) and to study their pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships. 
  The ability of racemic VCD, (2S,3S)-VCD, (2R,3S)-VCD and VPD to block partial seizures was studied in the 6Hz psychomotor seizure model in mice and in the hippocampal kindled rat. The ability of (2S,3S)-VCD and (2R,3S)-VCD to prevent generalized seizures was evaluated in the maximum electroshock (MES) and subcutaneous metrazole (sc Met) seizure tests. The PK of (2S,3S)-VCD, (2R,3S)-VCD, and VPD was studied in the mice utilized in the 6Hz model. 
  All of the tested compounds were effective in the models tested. No significant difference in ED  values was observed but the plasma and brain EC  values of (2R,3S)-VCD in the 6Hz model at 32 mA stimulation were 2-fold higher than the EC  values of (2S,3S)-VCD. An excellent pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic correlation was found between the plasma and brain concentrations of the VCD stereoisomers and their anticonvulsant effect in mice. Stereoselectivity was observed in clearance, volume of distribution, and in brain-to-plasma AUC ratio at a dose of 25 mg/kg, but the difference disappeared at higher doses as the clearance of the stereoisomers decreased and their half-life increased. For (2R,3S)-VCD the brain-to-plasma AUC ratio doubled at the tested dose range, while it remained constant for (2S,3S)-VCD. 
  Racemic VCD, VPD, (2R,3S)-VCD, and (2S,3S)-VCD are effective anticonvulsants in animal models of partial seizures and are more potent than VPA. The more favorable brain penetration of (2S,3S)-VCD and its lower EC  value in the 6Hz test provides one advantage over (2R,3S)-VCD as a new antiepileptic drug.",,,,2003

  The purpose of this work was to replace Cremophor-EL in the commercial paclitaxel intravenous formulation, Taxol®, using a novel high-throughput combinatorial formulation approach. 
  Full factorial combinations of 12 generally regarded as safe excipients at three different concentrations were screened using an automated liquid dispenser. The hit formulations were further optimized to give the final optimized formulation TPI-1. TPI-1 was then tested in rats to compare its pharmacokinetic profile to Taxol®. 
  Of the 9,880 combinations tested in the initial screen, 19 were identified as hit combinations. These were further optimized to give the final formulation TPI-1. When tested in rats, TPI-1 was well tolerated at both the low and high doses of 5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg, whereas Taxol® killed all the rats at the high dose. TPI-1 experienced slower elimination compared to Taxol®. Similar to Taxol®, TPI-1 also exhibited nonlinear pharmacokinetics.

  In this work, the alacepril thiolesterase, which catalyzes the hydrolyzing reaction of the thiolester linkage in alacepril and the conversion from alacepril to deacetylalacepril, was purified from rat liver cytosol and characterized. 
  A purification procedure for the thiolesterase consisted of ammonium sulfate fractionation and chromatographies with phenyl Sepharose CL-4B, Q Sepharose FF, ceramic hydroxylapatite, and phenyl Sepharose HP. The thiolesterase activity was assayed for alacepril as a substrate and the reaction product, deacetylalacepril, was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography. 
  The purified thiolesterase is heterodimeric with a molecular mass of 29 and 36 kDa subunits as estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate -polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. N-terminal amino acid sequence of these subunits reveals that the thiolesterase is identical to sialic acid 9- -acetylesterase. The thiolesterase hydrolyzes not only the thiolester bond in alacepril, spironolactone, and acetyl coenzyme A but also the carboxylester bond in α-naphtyl acetate. The alacepril thiolestrase activity is competitively inhibited by α-naphtyl acetate. 
  The thiolesterase, i.e., sialic acid 9- -acetylesterase, seems to be involved in the metabolism of certain drugs such as alacepril and spironolactone. However, drugs having ester-type and amide-type linkages, for example dilazep, aniracetam, and benazepril, are not substrates for the thiolestrase.",,,,2003

  A new experimental set-up for studying partitioning of ionizable drugs at the interface between two immiscible electrolyte solutions (ITIES) by amperometry is presented. The method is quite general, as it can be applied to any charged drug molecule. 
  The procedure is based on 96-well microfilter plates with microporous filters to support 96 organic liquid membranes. The new methodology is first validated using a series of tetra-alkylammonium ions and subsequently used to construct the ion partition diagrams of 3,5- , -tetramethylaniline and 2,4-dinitrophenol. The lipophilicity of these drugs was examined by potentiometry and cyclic voltammetry in the NPOE/water system. 
  Cyclic voltammetry resulted in potential-pH profiles of the studied drugs. When the aqueous phase p

 . To evaluate the   effects of an aerosolized cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor, nimesulide, on the cytotoxicity and apoptotic response of doxorubicin against the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549. 
 . Nimesulide was formulated into a metered dose inhaler (MDI) formulation and characterized for aerodynamic particle size and medication delivery. The   cytotoxicity of nimesulide-MDI in the presence or absence of doxorubicin was assessed by using the six-stage viable impactor by an already standardized method. Induction of apoptosis in A549 cells by nimesulide (nonaerosolized or aerosolized) in combination with doxorubicin was evaluated by established techniques such as caspase-3 estimation and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. Finally, to understand the mechanism of action, the influence of different treatments on the expression of COX-2 and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) in A549 cells was studied by immunoblotting. 
 . The nimesulide-MDI formulation had a mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of 1.1 μm, (GSD = 2.8) and a medication delivery of 51 μg/shot. Nimesulide-MDI (40 shots) in combination with doxorubicin (0.01 μg/ml) had a cell kill of more than 60% as determined by   cytotoxicity assay. The specific caspase-3 activity in A549 cells treated with nimesulide (40 μg/ml) and doxorubicin (0.25 μg/ml) in combination was 3 and 5 times higher than doxorubicin and nimesulide, respectively. Further, TUNEL staining showed apoptosis in over 30% of A549 cells treated with aerosolized nimesulide and doxorubicin combination vs. negligible as seen in cells treated individually. The expression of COX-2 was not altered in control or treatments, whereas PPAR-γ was expressed only in the combination treatment.

Multilamellar liposomal formulation was prepared by the thin-film hydration method and converted to unilamellar liposomes by extrusion. 
 . With transdermal iontophoresis, therapeutically relevant amounts of propranolol (83.78 ± 7.4 ng/ml) were delivered within an hour and lasted for up to 4 h. C  (185.1 ± 56.8 ng/ml) was reached at hour 3. A significantly higher amount (  < 0.05) of sotalol HCl was delivered compared to other β-blockers. There was no significant difference in the S/R ratio of AUC  for enantiomers after both intravenous and transdermal delivery. Skin irritation was significantly reduced (  < 0.05) when a liposomal formulation of the propranolol base was used rather than the base itself. 
 . The comparative pharmacokinetics of intravenous and transdermal iontophoretic delivery of five β-blockers in hairless rats was established. It was shown that there is no stereoselective permeation.",,,,2003

 . The flux of a topically applied drug depends on the activity in the skin and the interaction between the vehicle and skin. Permeation of vehicle into the skin can alter the activity of drug and the properties of the skin barrier. The aim of this   study was to separate and quantify these effects. 
 . The flux of four radiolabeled permeants (water, phenol, diflunisal, and diazepam) with log  
  values from 1.4 to 4.3 was measured over 4 h through heat-separated human epidermis pretreated for 30 min with vehicles having Hildebrand solubility parameters from 7.9 to 23.4 (cal/cm ) . 
 . Enhancement was greatest after pretreatment with the more lipophilic vehicles. A synergistic enhancement was observed using binary mixtures. The flux of diazepam was not enhanced to the same extent as the other permeants, possibly because its partitioning into the epidermis is close to optimal (log  
  2.96). 
 . An analysis of the permeant remaining in the epidermis revealed that the enhancement can be the result of either increased partitioning of permeant into the epidermis or an increasing diffusivity of permeants through the epidermis.",,,,2003

 . The objectives of this work were (a) to explore the potential of transdermal reverse iontophoresis for therapeutic drug monitoring and (b) to develop an “internal standard” calibration procedure so as to render the technique completely noninvasive. 
 . A series of   iontophoresis experiments was performed in which the subdermal concentration of sodium valproate was varied from 21 μM to 1 mM. Glutamic acid was also introduced into the subdermal donor at a fixed concentration to act as an “internal standard” for the calibration method. 
 . Both valproate and glutamate anions were recovered, as expected, at the anodal receptor chamber. The iontophoretic extraction flux of valproate was linearly correlated with the subdermal concentration. Glutamate flux was constant. It follows that the ratio of extracted fluxes (valproate/glutamate) was directly dependent upon (a) the subdermal valproate concentration and (b) the subdermal concentration ratio (valproate/glutamate), offering a means, thereby, to a completely noninvasive methodology. 
 . This work demonstrates the potential of reverse iontophoresis for noninvasive therapeutic monitoring. The simultaneous quantification of the analyte of interest and of an “internal standard” renders the withdrawal of a blood sample unnecessary.",,,,2003

  To examine whether the empirical Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW) equation is applicable not only to protein aggregation but also to protein denaturation in lyophilized formulations. Lyophilized β-galactosidase (β-GA) formulations containing polyvinylalcohol and methylcellulose were used as model formulations. The possibility of predicting storage stability based on the temperature dependence of the estimated parameters of inactivation/aggregation—time constant (τ) and its distribution (β) is discussed. 
  Protein aggregation in lyophilized β-GA formulations at 10-70°C and 6-43% relative humidity was determined as a function of time by size exclusion chromatography. Enzyme activity was also determined using 2-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactopyranoside as a substrate. 
  Inactivation and aggregation of β-GA were describable with the empirical KWW equation, regardless of whether the temperature was above or below the NMR relaxation-based critical mobility temperature (T ) or whether protein molecules with different degrees of deformation resulting from stresses during lyophilization exist in the formulation. The estimated β parameter for protein aggregation decreased rapidly as temperature increased beyond T  because the mobility of polymer molecules increased in the initial stages of glass transition. The time required for 10% enzyme to aggregate (t ) calculated from the τ and β parameters exhibited a change in temperature dependence gradient near T . In contrast, t  for protein inactivation exhibited temperature dependence patterns varying with the excipients. 
  The t  calculated from the estimated τ and β parameters was found to be a useful parameter for evaluating the stability of lyophilized β-GA formulations. The prediction of t  by extrapolation was possible in the temperature range in which β did not rapidly vary with temperature.",,,,2003

  To study mixtures of SDS and the drugs diphenhydramine, tetracaine, and amitriptyline to compile phase diagrams and to investigate the use of interesting phases for sustained release from gels. 
  Phase diagrams were composed by studying large numbers of different compositions of negatively charged SDS and positively charged drug compounds visually, rheologically, and by cryo-transmission electron microscopy. Drug release from Carbopol 940 and agar gels containing interesting phases, e.g., vesicle and branched micelle phases, was measured   by the USP paddle method. 
  Vesicles and elongated and branched micelles were formed on the SDS-rich side in all three systems examined. The tetracaine system differed from the other two in that it showed a vesicle area in the drug-rich side. Release of diphenhydramine from Carbopol 940 gels was slowed by at least a factor of 10 when in the form of vesicles or branched micelles. The same delay was found for both drug-rich and SDS-rich tetracaine vesicles. 
  Mixtures of SDS and positively charged drugs form the same interesting phases as traditional catanionic mixtures. This may prove useful in obtaining functional controlled-release systems when using gels as drug carriers.",,,,2003

  To investigate the hypothesis that faster drug absorption from a new paracetamol formulation containing sodium bicarbonate compared to that from a conventional formulation results from a combination of enhanced gastric emptying and disintegration/dissolution. 
  Each formulation was administered in both fasted and fed states to 12 healthy volunteers. Gastric emptying and disintegration times were assessed by γ scintigraphy, and serum paracetamol concentrations were determined by HPLC. 
  The mean time to complete disintegration of the new tablets was faster than that for conventional tablets in both fasted (10.2 min vs. 22.5 min) and fed (14.3 min vs. 46.4 min) states, although this difference was statistically significant in the fed state only (p = 0.0053). Mean gastric emptying times for the new tablets, as measured by t  and t , were also faster than those for conventional tablets in both fasted (t  = 22.4 min vs. 47.5 min, t  = 30.9 min vs. 64.1 min) and fed (t  = 76.9 min vs. 106.4 min, t  = 152.7 min vs. 155.5 min) states, although these differences were not statistically significant. Two subjects showed dramatically retarded gastric emptying of the new tablets in the fasted state: if these atypical data are excluded, the differences in both t  and t  in the fasted state are significant (p = 0.0110 and 0.0035, respectively). Rate of paracetamol absorption reflected the gastric emptying profiles as shown by significant correlation of emptying times with partial AUC. 
  It would seem that a combination of faster disintegration and gastric emptying of the new tablets is responsible for the faster rate of absorption of paracetamol from PA compared to P observed in both this study and in previous studies. The differences in gastric emptying are more pronounced in the fasted state, and the differences in disintegration are more pronounced in the fed state.",,,,2003

  The aim of the present work was to develop a new   system to evaluate oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs by utilizing Caco-2 monolayers. 
  Caco-2 monolayer was mounted between side-by-side chambers, which enabled the simultaneous assay of dissolution and permeation of drugs (dissolution/permeation system; D/P system). Apical and basal sides of the chamber were filled with buffer solutions. Drugs were applied to the apical side as powder, suspension, or solution, and then, the permeated amounts into the basal side were monitored for 2 h. At the same time, dissolved amounts of drugs at the apical side were detected. The amount of drug applied to the D/P system was based on its   clinical dose. 
  Sodium taurocholate (5 mM, apical side) and bovine serum albumin (4.5% w/v, basal side) increased the permeated amount of poorly water-soluble drugs. Both additives were considered to be effective at mimicking   conditions of intestinal drug absorption. From the correlation between the permeated amount of 13 drugs (% dose/2 h) in the D/P system and their percentage dose absorbed in humans  , this system was found to be useful in evaluating oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs. 
  With attempts made to mimic the physiologic conditions of the human GI tract,   oral absorption of drugs was quantitatively assessed in the D/P system  . This system is quite useful to predict the oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs after administration as solid dosage forms.",,,,2003

  To design and evaluate a new class of soft anticholinergics with subtype selectivity. 
  A new class of soft anticholinergics was designed based on the “inactive metabolite” approach. Four compounds were synthesized. The potency and soft nature of the compounds were evaluated by receptor binding, cardiac, and mydriatic studies. Stability and pharmacokinetic studies were also performed on these newly synthesized soft anticholinergics. 
  Receptor binding studies of the soft anticholinergics on cloned muscarinic receptors indicated p i values in the range of 7.5 to 8.9. Two compounds, 9a and 13a, of the series showed muscarinic subtype receptor selectivity (M /M ). In mydriatic studies, 13a and 13b showed shorter duration of action in the treated eyes than tropicamide. In the control eyes, significant dilation of pupils was found only in rabbits treated with atropine and tropicamide, indicating that the soft anticholinergics lack systemic effects because of their facile hydrolytic deactivation. Consistent with their soft nature, this new class of soft anticholinergics displayed much shorter cardiovascular effects in the carbachol-induced bradycardia (10 to 15 min) in rats than atropine (> 60 min). Stability and pharmacokinetic studies suggested that the new soft anticholinergics were rapidly eliminated from plasma (systemic circulation) after i.v. administration.

  To evaluate the feasibility of using a serially passaged culture of human nasal epithelial cell monolayers on a permeable support for   drug transport studies. The optimum conditions for passaged culture as well as the correlation between the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) value and drug permeability (P ) were evaluated. 
  Fresh human nasal epithelial cells were collected from normal inferior turbinates and were subcultured repeatedly in serum-free bronchial epithelial cell growth media (BEGM) in petri dishes. The subcultured cells of each passage were seeded onto permeable supports at 5 × 10  cells/cm  and grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM). Morphologic characteristics were observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). To verify the formation of tight junctions, actin staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies were conducted. In the drug transport study, [ C]mannitol and budesonide were selected as the paracellular and the transcellular route markers, respectively. 
  Serially passaged cells were successfully cultured on a permeable support and showed significantly high TEER values up to passage 4. After 14 days of seeding, SEM showed microvilli, and protrusions of cilia and mucin granules were detected by TEM. The paracellular marker [ C]mannitol showed a nearly constant permeability coefficient (P ) when the TEER value exceeded 500 Ω·cm  regardless of the passage number. However, as expected, budesonide showed a higher permeability coefficient compared to [ C]mannitol and was less affected by the TEER value.

  The aim of this study was to find new biocompatible surfactants and mixtures with low ocular irritant action for application in pharmaceutical formulations and to establish a relationship between their structure and their potential ocular irritant activity. 
  An alternative method to the Draize   test, based on the adverse effects of surfactants on the cytoplasmic membrane of red blood cell, was used to evaluate the potential ocular irritation of the surfactants. 
  It was found that the hemolytic activity of arginine-based gemini surfactants increased with the aliphatic alkyl chain lengths of the hydrophobic tail. The addition of the surfactant with an alkyl chain length of 10 carbon atoms to cocoamidopropilbetaina (TB), decylglucoside (APG), and N -lauroyl-arginine ethyl ester (LAE) increases the hemolytic activity moderately for the mixtures with TB and LAE (1.1- and 1.5-fold, respectively) and strongly for APG (fivefold). 
  The new arginine-based gemini surfactants constitute a suitable alternative to commercial surfactants because of their natural origins, which make them biocompatible and renewable products. Based on their hemolytic activity as an alternative to the Draize test, these new arginine-based gemini surfactants and their mixtures can be classified as mild irritants. This fact constitutes an advantage, especially for pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications.",,,,2003

  The objectives of this study were to characterize sepia, synthetic, and bovine melanin and to determine their binding characteristics to the drug memantine. 
  Physical methods were used to characterize sepia, synthetic, and bovine melanin. Their binding properties toward memantine were determined in deionized water and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 37°C. Melanin-memantine binding was measured indirectly by determining the unbound fraction of memantine. Curve fitting according to the Langmuir binding isotherm for one binding site was used for the determination of binding capacity  
 
  and dissociation constant  
 
 . 
  Synthetic and sepia melanin had comparable Gaussian particle size distributions, whereas bovine melanin showed a heterogeneous distribution profile. The suspension medium had a small effect on the particle size distribution of synthetic and bovine melanin. There were characteristic differences in the infrared spectra of the melanins. The rank order for  
  in deionized water was sepia > bovine > synthetic melanin. However, when the melanins were suspended in PBS, the  
  values were lower, and the rank order was bovine > sepia > synthetic. Whereas the  
  values for sepia and synthetic melanin remained largely the same in deionized water and PBS, the  
  value for bovine melanin in PBS was more than twice than in deionized water. 
  This study showed that the physical characteristics of the melanins investigated differ markedly. The binding of memantine to melanin is thought to be determined by the different chemistries of the melanins, particle size, and buffer electrolytes.",,,,2003

  The association of hydrophobic, cationic drugs with lung surfactant was determined to assess the pharmacokinetic implications on drug disposition and retention in the lung. 
  The distribution coefficients, K, were determined at 25 and 37° in normal saline solution buffered at pH 7.4 for a series of structurally related, cationic drugs. Drugs were dispersed into lung surfactant, equilibrated, and then centrifuged to separate the aqueous phase from the surfactant pellet. Drug concentrations in the supernatant and pellet were determined following dilution using spectrophotometric assays. In addition, the apparent acid dissociation constant of quinacrine in the presence and absence of surfactant was determined by measuring the pH-dependent absorption spectra. The effect of stereochemistry on the distribution of drugs into surfactant was examined with   and  propranolol. 
  The mole fraction distribution coefficients for amitriptyline, promethazine, promazine, ethopropazine, imipramine, R-propranolol, and S-propranolol at 25°C were 6,560 ± 500, 28,400 ± 1,500, 12,100 ± 840, 5,480 ± 330, 4,490 ± 250, 8,680 ± 260, 8,190 ± 530, respectively. At 37°C, the distribution coefficients were generally smaller indicating a significant exothermic heat of transfer for these solutes from aqueous solution to the lung surfactant. The pKa of quinacrine was 7.43 ± 0.04 in aqueous solution and was shifted to 7.62 ± 0.06 in the presence of lung surfactant. From this shift, the double layer potential for quinacrine-lung surfactant was estimated to be −0.012 V assuming a dielectric constant equivalent to that of water. 
  Cationic drugs have very favorable distributions from an aqueous solution to the lipid phase of lung surfactant. The transfer process generally has both a large entropic and enthalpic contribution. The latter thermodynamic aspect may be related to the charge interaction between the solute and the negatively charged surfactant. Finally, no significant effect of stereochemistry was evident with the distribution of   and  propranolol.",,,,2003

  We successfully manufactured nanoparticles of biodegradable polymers for controlled release of paclitaxel. TPGS (d-α-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol 1000 succinate) could be a novel material to make nanoparticles of high drug encapsulation efficiency (EE) and desired physicochemical and pharmaceutical properties of the drug loaded nanoparticles. Among various controlling parameters in the process, the present work is to elucidate the effects of the surfactant stabilizer and the drug loading ratio.

  To investigate the potential of different solvents with better biocompatibility to replace CH Cl  in the encapsulation of α-chymotrypsin in poly (lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) microspheres without causing protein instability. 
  The oil-to-water (O:W) ratio in the emulsification step of the solid-in-oil-in-water (s/o/w) encapsulation process was optimized with respect to maximizing protein stability and encapsulation efficiency for various solvents. Formation of insoluble aggregates and residual enzyme activity were primarily used as stability parameters. Several solvents possessing low toxicity with different water solubility were used to prepare α-chymotrypsin loaded PLGA microspheres. 
  The O:W ratio in the emulsification step is critical with respect to maintaining protein stability. This was related to the solvents' water solubility. In general, hydrophilic solvents were detrimental to protein stability and encapsulation efficiency. However, after optimization of the O:W ratio for solvents with different water solubility, protein stability was preserved during encapsulation using butyl acetate when poly (ethylene glycol) (PEG) was used as the emulsifying agent (ca. 1% of non-covalent aggregates and 93 ± 10% of residual specific activity).

 With this publication a subcommittee of the AAPS Ligand Binding Assay Bioanalytical Focus Group (LBABFG) makes recommendations for the development, validation, and implementation of ligand binding assays (LBAs) that are intended to support pharmacokinetic and toxicokinetic assessments of macromolecules. 
  This subcommittee was comprised of 10 members representing Pharmaceutical, Biotechnology, and the contract research organization industries from the United States, Canada, and Europe. Each section of this consensus document addresses a specific analytical performance characteristic or aspect for validation of a LBA. Within each section the topics are organized by an assay's life cycle, the development phase, pre-study validation, and in-study validation. Because unique issues often accompany bioanalytical assays for macromolecules, this document should be viewed as a guide for designing and conducting the validation of ligand binding assays. 
  Values of ±20% (25% at the lower limit of quantification [LLOQ]) are recommended as default acceptance criteria for accuracy (% relative error [RE], mean bias) and interbatch precision (%coefficient of variation [CV]). In addition, we propose as secondary criteria for method acceptance that the sum of the interbatch precision (%CV) and the absolute value of the mean bias (%RE) be less than or equal to 30%. This added criterion is recommended to help ensure that in-study runs of test samples will meet the proposed run acceptance criteria of 4-6-30. Exceptions to the proposed process and acceptance criteria are appropriate when accompanied by a sound scientific rationale.

 . We synthesized a new monomer carbonic acid 2-dimethylamino-ethyl ester 1-methyl-2-(2-methacryloylamino)-ethyl ester (abbreviated HPMA-DMAE) and the corresponding polymer. Hydrolysis of the carbonate ester of both the monomer and the polymer was investigated at 37°C. The DNA condensing properties of the pHPMA-DMAE was studied using dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements. Degradation of the polyplexes at 37°C and pH 7.4 was monitored with DLS and gel electrophoresis.   transfections were performed in COS-7 cell line. 
 . pHPMA-DMAE is able to condense DNA into small particles (110 nm) with a positive zeta potential. The half-life of the polymer and monomer at 37°C and pH 7.4 was around 10 h whereas at pH 5, the half-life was 380 h. In line with this, due to hydrolysis of the side groups, pHPMA-DMAE-based polyplexes dramatically increased in size at 37°C and pH 7.4 whereas at pH 5.0, only a very small increase was observed. Interestingly, intact DNA was released from the polyplexes after 48 h at pH 7.4 whereas all DNA remained bound to the polymer at pH 5.0. Polyplexes were able to transfect cells with minimal cytotoxicity if the endosomal membrane-disrupting peptide INF-7 was added to the polyplex formulation.

 . To understand the influence of water in the crystal structure on the compaction properties of otherwise structurally similar crystals,  -hydroxybenzoic acid anhydrate (HA) and the monohydrate (HM) were used as model compounds. 
 . Bulk powder of HM was prepared by exposing HA powder to 97% relative humidity at 23°C. Each powder, HA or HM, was uniaxially compressed and triaxially decompressed under various pressures to form square-faced tablets. The tensile strength and porosity of the tablets were measured. 
 . Incorporation of water into the crystal lattice results in greater tablet strength and larger reduction in volume for HM crystals than for HA crystals. Both HA and HM crystals contain hydrogen-bonded, zigzag-shaped layers that lie parallel to the (401) plane. When HA crystals are compressed, the zigzag-shaped layers mechanically interlock, inhibiting slip and reducing plasticity. However, water molecules in the HM crystals assume a space-filling role, which increases the separation of the layers. This effect allows easier slip between layers and provides greater plasticity of HM crystals, which increases the interparticulate bonding area under the same compaction pressure. However, the water molecules in the HM crystals increase their lattice energy by forming a three-dimensional hydrogen-bonding network. The greater bonding strength that results is reflected in greater tensile strength of HM compacts at zero porosity. 
 . The presence of water molecules in the crystal structure of  -hydroxybenzoic acid facilitates plastic deformation of HM crystals, thereby enhancing their bonding strength and giving much stronger tablets than of HA crystals.",,,,2004

Sublimation rates of vials with intentional nominal and extreme dimensions were measured and directly correlated to glass vial design features using conservative and aggressive lyophilization parameters to amplify subtle differences in rates. Purified water, USP was used to alleviate the inhibition to mass transfer due to the presence of excipient and drug substances. Further studies quantified the effect of bottom concavity on sublimation rate while using model preparations to illustrate the impact of processing crystalline and amorphous material. 
  The results from the Plackett-Burman statistical screening experiment indicate that sublimation rate is influenced by glass type, vial diameter, bottom radius, and fill volume. Results from further studies verify that the influence of concavity on sublimation rate is statistically insignificant. 
  The results from the Plackett-Burman screening experiment reflect that vial diameter has the greatest impact on sublimation rate. Further studies confirm that various bottom concavities do not substantially influence sublimation rate.",,,,2004

  The purpose of this work was to monitor polymorphic transformations of glycine during the drying phase of a wet granulation and model the polymorphic conversions using a time-based reconciliation model. 
  Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) was used for quantitation of polymorphs, and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) was used for qualitative analysis of polymorphs. 
  The data show that the faster the granulation was dried, the more kinetic trapping of the metastable  -glycine polymorph, as predicted by reconciliation of the time scales of both the drying rate and the rate of the solution-mediated conversion. 
  By knowing basic properties of the drug substance (solubility of the polymorphic forms and the rate of the solution-mediated conversion), processing conditions, such as the drying rate, can be adjusted to anticipate and prevent potential polymorphic transformations.",,,,2004

 . The purpose of this investigation was i) to study the effect of physical aging on crystallization and water vapor sorption behavior of amorphous anhydrous trehalose prepared by freeze-drying, and ii) to determine the effects of water sorption on the relaxation state of the aged material. 
 . Freeze-dried trehalose was aged at 100°C for varying time periods to obtain samples with different degrees of relaxation. The glass transition temperature (T ) and enthalpic relaxation were determined by differential scanning calorimetry, and the rate and extent of water uptake at different relative humidity values were quantified using an automated vapor sorption balance. 
 . Annealing below the T  caused nucleation in the amorphous trehalose samples, which decreased the crystallization onset temperature on subsequent heating. However, no crystallization was observed below the T  even after prolonged annealing. Physical aging caused a decrease in the rate and extent of water vapor sorption at low relative humidity values. Moreover, the water sorption removed the effects of physical aging, thus effectively causing enthalpic recovery in the aged samples. This recovery occurred gradually in the glassy phase and was not associated with a glass to rubber transition. We believe this aging reversal to be due to volume expansion during water sorption in the amorphous structure. 
 . Thermal history of amorphous materials is a crucial determinant of their physical properties. Aging of amorphous trehalose led to nucleation below the T , and decrease in rate and extent of water sorption. Sorption of water resulted in irreversible changes in the relaxation state of the aged material.",,,,2004

  The main objectives of this work are to study the behavior of fluid imbibition into a consolidated matrix through a wet invasive conductivimetric technique, to investigate if the changes in the behavior observed can be related to the drug percolation threshold, and to use this technique for its estimation. 
  Matrix tablets were prepared using five sieving fractions of KCl and Eudragit RS-PM.   release assays were carried out on 45 batches. The drug percolation thresholds were estimated following the method of Leuenberger and Bonny, and the results were compared to the obtained employing the conductivimetric technique described in this paper. 
  The wet conductivimetric technique and the standard method provided similar results for the estimation of the percolation threshold. The presented technique also provides quantitative information about the consolidated matrix. 
  A new apparatus has been developed for the study of the conductivimetric behavior of matrix tablets during water uptake. This technique provides measurable parameters of fluid penetration and can be used to estimate the drug percolation threshold, providing similar results to the Leuenberger and Bonny method and being clearly faster.",,,,2004

  The purpose of this study was to use polymer blends for the coating of pellets and to study the effects of the type of coating technique (aqueous vs. organic) on drug release. 
  Propranolol HCl-loaded pellets were coated with blends of a water-insoluble and an enteric polymer (ethyl cellulose and Eudragit L). Drug release from the pellets as well as the mechanical properties, water uptake, and dry weight loss behavior of thin polymeric films were determined in 0.1 M HCl and phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. 
  Drug release strongly depended on the type of coating technique. Interestingly, not only the slope, but also the shape of the release curves was affected, indicating changes in the underlying drug release mechanisms. The observed effects could be explained by the higher mobility of the macromolecules in organic solutions compared to aqueous dispersions, resulting in higher degrees of polymer-polymer interpenetration and, thus, tougher and less permeable film coatings. The physicochemical properties of the latter were of major importance for the control of drug release, which was governed by diffusion through the intact polymeric films and/or water-filled cracks. 
  The type of coating technique strongly affects the film microstructure and, thus, the release mechanism and rate from pellets coated with polymer blends.",,,,2004

  To study the degradation of oxaliplatin in chloride media and evaluate the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin in normal and chloride-deficient medium. 
  The products of the reaction of oxaliplatin with chloride were separated on a Hypercarb S column with a mobile phase containing 40% methanol in 0.05 M ammonia and subjected to electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. The cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin in normal and chloride-deficient medium was evaluated by 30-min incubations on human colon adenocarcinoma cells (HT-29). 
  We identified a new intermediate degradation product, the monochloro monooxalato complex ([Pt(dach)oxCl] ) and the final product, the dichloro complex (Pt(dach)Cl ), by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. [Pt(dach)oxCl]  was found as the negative ion, M , at   431, and the positive ion, [M+2H] ,   433. Pt(dach)Cl  was found as the negative ion, [M-H] ,   377, and the positive ion, [M+NH ] ,   396. The fast initial degradation of oxaliplatin can be coupled to the fast formation of [Pt(dach)oxCl] . In the cytotoxic assay, the cell survival was not affected by the chloride levels.

  Simple rules based on readily accessible physicochemical properties enable identification of solutes that penetrate skin very slowly or rapidly. 
  Literature   maximal flux values (J ) across human skin were collected for 87 penetrants. Penetrants were assigned as “good” (J  > 10  mole·cm ·h ), “bad” (J  < 10  mole·cm ·h ) or “intermediate” based on mean ± 1SD. The feasibility of using readily available physicochemical properties, such as molecular weight (MW), melting point (MP,°K), octanol-water partition coefficient (K), water solubility (S, molarity), number of atoms available for H-bonding (HB), in assigning solutes was examined. 
  Good penetrants had MW ≤ 152, log S > -2.3, HB ≤ 5, log K < 2.6, MP ≤ 432. Bad penetrants had MW > 213, log S < -1.6, HB ≥ 4, log K > 1.2, MP ≥ 223. Discriminant analysis using MW, HB, log K correctly assigned 70% of compounds. Individual success rates were good (88%), intermediate (58%), bad (93%). Aqueous J  data for 148 test solutes were used for validation. Discriminant analysis assigned 76% of compounds, with individual rates of good (76%), intermediate (67%), and bad (97%). No good penetrants were misclassified as bad or  a.

  The aim of this study was to characterize the   pharmacokinetics with the enterohepatic circulation (EHC) and identify the role of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2/Mrp2) in biliary excretion and absorption of ramatroban, a thromboxane A  antagonist using a recirculatory model. 
  Ramatroban was intravenously or orally administered to Sprague-Dawley rats (SDR) and Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR). Portal and systemic blood and bile samples were collected, and the drug concentrations were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to estimate various global and local moments. 
  The bioavailability ( ) of ramatroban was estimated at 21.0% in SDR and 61.9% in EHBR. The local absorption ratio for the dosage after oral administration ( 
 
 ) and the single-pass local absorption ratio for EHC ( 
 ) in the rats were similar and nearly 100%. The hepatic recovery ratio ( 
 ) and the single-pass biliary excretion ratio through the liver for the sum of ramatroban and its glucuronides ( 
 ) in EHBR were 61.4% and 8.88%, respectively, which differed considerably from those in SDR (15.0% and 22.4%). The difference in hepatic elimination between these strains would be caused, at least in part, by the reduced biliary excretion in EHBR, although the biliary excretion was not completely impaired. 
  Ramatroban may be excreted by multiple transport systems, followed by efficient enterohepatic reabsorption in both strains. The results suggest that ramatroban may not be susceptible to drug-drug interaction involving MRP2/Mrp2 in biliary excretion and absorption.",,,,2004

 .We describe here a new method to estimate the oral drug permeability from the small intestine using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. The interaction between drugs and brush border membrane (BBM) surfaces immobilized on biosensor chip were evaluated by measuring the SPR response signal. 
 . BBM vesicles, isolated from Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, were immobilized onto the L1 chip composed of dextran derivatives with modified lipophilic residues. A SPR (BIAcore 3000) was used with L1 chip, and it was carried out in a running buffer, HEPES-buffered saline containing 0.1% DMSO. Fourteen drugs for the SPR experiments were flowed over the BBM immobilized L1 chip, and the response levels according to the BBM surfaces were evaluated directly in a continuous flow system. 
 . The immobilized BBM surface on L1 chip was very stable, and it was regenerated by injecting a new BBM vesicle solution. It was evident that drug binding events, using BBM surfaces, directly provides information that predicts the F  value in human for transcellularly absorbed drugs. The throughput to assay each drug at a single concentration is 100 drugs for 24 h.

 . Biodegradable microparticles prepared from poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) have been shown to be promising carrier systems for vaccine delivery. Here, we have investigated the capacity of different PLA and PLGA microparticle formulations to induce stimulation of human blood monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). 
 . Stimulation of human derived dendritic cells by plain microparticles were compared with microparticles loaded with plasmid DNA or double-stranded salmon DNA either by encapsulation or adsorption to the surface of cationic microparticles. Stimulation of DCs was monitored by the up-regulation of surface maturation markers CD83 and CD86 and the secretion of IL-12 and TNF-α. 
 . Slowly degrading PLA microparticles did not induce any detectable stimulation or activation of DCs. In contrast, fast degrading PLGA microparticles were able to influence DC maturation and cytokine secretion dependent on their surface charge. Anionic PLGA microparticles induced an up-regulation of CD83 and high TNF-α secretion, which was further enhanced up to the level of the potent stimulator lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when plasmid DNA was encapsulated. Moreover, the secretion of significant amounts of IL-12 was observed. Cationic PLGA microparticles induced an up-regulation of CD86 and moderate TNF-α secretion, but no IL-12 secretion, with no additional effects in the presence of plasmid DNA. 
 . The data suggest that the composition and charge of biodegradable DNA-loaded microparticles profoundly influences maturation and cytokine secretion in DCs. Thus, the individual formulation of microparticles used as a vaccine carrier system might considerably influence the profile of the immune response.",,,,2004

 . To investigate whether cell penetrating peptides (CPP) derived from human calcitonin (hCT) possess, in addition to cellular uptake, the capacity to deliver their cargo through epithelial barriers. 
 . Cellular uptake of hCT(9-32) and permeation of six hCT-derived peptides, namely, hCT(9-32), hCT(12-32), hCT(15-32), hCT(18-32), hCT(21-32), and a random sequence of hCT(9-32) were evaluated in fully organized confluent Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), Calu-3, and TR146 cell culture models. For comparison, Tat(47-57) and penetratin(43-58) were investigated. The peptides were N-terminally labeled with carboxyfluorescein (CF). Uptake in the well-differentiated epithelial models was observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), whereas permeation through the models was analyzed by reversed-phase (RP)-HPLC. 
 . In MDCK epithelium hCT(9-32), Tat(47-57) and penetratin(43-58) demonstrated punctuated cytoplasmic distribution. In Calu-3, Tat(47-57) and penetratin(43-58) were simultaneously localized in a punctuated cytoplasmic and paracellular distribution, whereas hCT(9-32) showed strict paracellular distribution. By contrast, in TR146 cells, Tat(47-57) was located strictly paracellularily, whereas penetratin(43-58) showed a punctuated cytoplasmic pattern and hCT(9-32) both. The transepithelial permeability of all tested peptides and their cargo was lower than that of paracellular markers. 
 . The CPP uptake pattern depends on both the type of peptide and the cell culture model. In general, the investigated CPP have no apparent potential for systemic drug delivery across epithelia. Nevertheless, distinct patterns of cellular distribution may offer a potential for localized epithelial delivery.",,,,2004

 . This study was to elucidate the mechanism of cellular uptake of cholesteryl 1,12-dicarba-closo-dodecaboranel-carboxylate (BCH), a new anti-cancer carborane derivative of cholesteryl ester, by glioma cancer cells. 
 . BCH (solubilized with liposomal formulation) was incubated with SF-763 and SF-767 glioma cell lines in the presence of different amounts of monoclonal anti-LDL receptor antibody for cellular uptake studies. Various amounts of lipoprotein deficient serum (LPDS) were also used during the uptake. The effect of calcium ion and low temperature on BCH uptake were investigated. In addition, the transfer of BCH from liposomes to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles was determined through gradient ultracentrifugation. 
 . BCH uptake by these glioma cells was significantly inhibited by the monoclonal antibody. The uptake by both cell lines was reversely correlated with the amount of LPDS. The presence of calcium ion promoted the BCH uptake, whereas the low temperature decreased the BCH uptake. After 16 h incubation, about 46% of BCH was transferred from liposomes to LDL particles. 
 . These results strongly suggested that the cellular uptake of BCH (in liposomal formulation) by SF-763 and SF-767 glioma cell lines is mediated through LDL receptors.",,,,2004

 . The effects of flavonoids on BCRP-mediated transport were examined by evaluating their effects on mitoxantrone accumulation and cytotoxicity in MCF-7 MX100 cells overexpressing BCRP. The EC  values of these flavonoids for increasing mitoxantrone accumulation were estimated using a Hill equation. The potential interactions among multiple flavonoids with regard to BCRP inhibition were assessed by isobologram and Berenbaum's interaction index methods. 
 . The EC  values of these flavonoids for increasing mitoxantrone accumulation ranged from 0.39 ± 0.13 μM to 33.7 ± 2.78 μM. Quantitative analysis of the combined effects of multiple flavonoids on mitoxantrone accumulation indicated that these flavonoids act additively in inhibiting BCRP when given as 2-, 3-, 5-, or 8-flavonoid combinations with equimolar concentrations of all constituents. The results of the mitoxantrone cytotoxicity studies were consistent with these findings. 
 . The additive effects of multiple flavonoids for BCRP inhibition suggests that prediction of BCRP-mediated food (herbal product)-drug interactions should also take into consideration the presence of multiple flavonoids and provides a rationale for using “flavonoid cocktails” as a potential approach for multidrug resistance reversal in cancer treatment.",,,,2004

 . Some therapeutic peptides exhibit amyloidogenic properties that cause insolubility and cytotoxicity against neuronal cells  . Here, we characterize the conformational change in monomeric therapeutic peptide to its fibrillar aggregate in order to prevent amyloidogenic formation during clinical application. 
 . Therapeutic peptides including glucagon, porcine secretin, and salmon calcitonin were dissolved in acidic solution at concen- trations ranging from 1 mg/ml to 80 mg/ml and then aged at 37°C. Amyloidogenic properties were assessed by circular dichroism (CD), electron microscopy (EM), staining with β-sheet-specific dyes, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Cytotoxic characteristics were determined concomitantly. 
 . By aging at 2.5 mg/ml or higher for 24 h, monomeric glucagon was converted to fibrillar aggregates consisting of a β-sheet-rich structure with multimeric states of glucagon. Although no aggregation was observed by aging at the clinical concentration of 1 mg/ml for 1 day, 30-day aging resulted in the generation of fibrillar aggregates. The addition of anti-glucagon serum significantly inhibited fibrillar conversion of monomeric glucagon. Glucagon fibrils induced significant cell death and activated an apoptotic enzyme, caspase-3, in PC12 cells and NIH-3T3 cells. Caspase inhibitors attenuated this toxicity in a dose-dependent manner, indicating the involvement of apoptotic signaling pathways in the fibrillar formation of glucagon. On the contrary to glucagon, salmon calcitonin exhibited aggregation at a much higher concentration of 40 mg/ml and secretin showed no aggregation at the concentration as high as 75 mg/ml. 
 . These results indicated that glucagon was self-associated by its β-sheet-rich intermolecular structure during the aging process under concentrated conditions to induce fibrillar aggregates. Glucagon has the same amyloidogenic propensities as pathologically related peptides such as β-amyloid (Aβ)  and prion protein fragment (PrP)  including conformational change to a β-sheet-rich structure and cytotoxic effects by activating caspases. These findings suggest that inappropriate preparation and application of therapeutic glucagon may cause undesirable insoluble products and side effects such as amyloidosis in clinical application.",,,,2004

 . To determine whether female sex-steroid hormones and their metabolites can modulate P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression and catalytic activity and to investigate P-gp mediated transport of these sex-steroids across  -transfected Madine-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. 
 . Changes in P-gp protein and   mRNA expression levels were examined in the presence of various estrogens and progestins after a 72-h induction period in the LS180 human colon carcinoma cell line via Western blotting and semiquantitative Reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), respectively. Concentration-dependent stimulation of vanadate-sensitive P-gp ATPase activity was measured in membranes of Sf9 insect cells infected with a recombinant baculovirus containing the human   cDNA used with appropriate control membranes. MDCK and  -transfected MDCK cell lines were then used to measure bidirectional P-gp transport of various steroids in the presence and absence of the P-gp inhibitor, GG918. Samples obtained were quantified using LC/MS. 
 . Our findings show that P-gp protein levels are inducible by estrone (4-fold over control), estriol (2-fold), and ethynyl estradiol (3-fold).   mRNA expression levels were also inducible in a concentration-dependent manner from 25 nM to 10 μM. Bidirectional transport studies indicate that ethynyl estradiol, estrone, and estriol are all substrates for P-gp with respective efflux ratios of 10.3, 6.9, and 2.8. Norethindrone was not found to be a substrate for P-gp. Ethynyl estradiol and progesterone were able to significantly stimulate P-gp ATPase activity in a concentration-dependent manner. 
 . Our studies indicate that several sex-steroid hormones are substrates for P-gp-mediated transport and are also able to induce P-gp expression at both the protein and mRNA level  . Stimulation of P-gp ATPase catalytic activity by steroid hormones was also observed, suggesting physical interactions and identifying a need for further investigations to understand the   effects of endogenous and synthetic steroid hormones on the expression and function of P-gp.",,,,2004

 . The isolation of hepatocytes from intact liver involves collagenase digestion of the tissue, resulting in loss of cell polarization and functional vectorial excretion. These studies examined re-polarization, localization of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to the canalicular domain of the hepatocyte, and re-establishment of vectorial transport in sandwich-cultured (SC) rat and human primary hepatocytes. 
 . Protein localization and expression were determined in SC hepatocytes by confocal microscopy and Western blotting, respectively. Transporter function was evaluated by measuring [D-penicillamine ]enkephalin ( H-DPDPE) and 5 (and 6)-carboxy-2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (CDF) biliary excretion in SC hepatocytes. 
 . P-gp and the canalicular marker protein dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) co-localized by Day 3 and Day 6 in SC rat hepatocytes and SC human hepatocytes, respectively, consistent with canalicular network formation visualized by light microscopy. Co-localization of multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2) and P-gp in SC human hepatocytes was observed on Day 6 in culture. Expression levels of P-gp increased slightly in both species over days in culture; similar expression was observed for MRP2 in SC human hepatocytes. Oatp1a1 expression in SC rat hepatocytes was maintained over days in culture, whereas Oatp1a4 expression decreased. OATP1B1 expression decreased slightly on Day 3 in SC human hepatocytes. OATP1B3 expression was constant in SC human hepatocytes.   biliary excretion of the opioid peptide  H-DPDPE correlated with the proper localization of canalicular proteins in both species. Excretion of CDF in SC human hepatocytes confirmed network formation and MRP2 function.

 . The purpose of this study was to analyze the transport of amino acid esters and the amino-acid-based prodrug valganciclovir by the Na /Cl -coupled amino acid transporter ATB . 
 . The interaction of amino acid esters and valganciclovir with the cloned rat ATB  was evaluated in a mammalian cell expression system and in the   oocyte expression system. 
 . In mammalian cells, expression of ATB  induced glycine uptake. This uptake was inhibited by valine and its methyl, butyl, and benzyl esters. The benzyl esters of other neutral amino acids were also effective inhibitors. Valganciclovir, the valyl ester of ganciclovir, was also found to inhibit ATB -mediated glycine uptake competitively. Exposure of ATB -expressing oocytes to glycine induced inward currents. Exposure to different valyl esters (methyl, butyl, and benzyl), benzyl esters of various neutral amino acids, and valganciclovir also induced inward currents in these oocytes. The current induced by valganciclovir was saturable with a K  value of 3.1 ± 0.7 mM and was obligatorily dependent on Na  and Cl . The Na :Cl :valganciclovir stoichiometry was 2 or 3:1:1. 
  Amino acid esters and the amino-acid-based prodrug valganciclovir are transported by ATB . This shows that ATB  can serve as an effective delivery system for amino acid-based prodrugs.",,,,2004

  R-123 accumulation by Caco-2 cells with MePEG - -PCL  was measured in the presence of endocytosis inhibitors or under ATP depletion conditions. Directional flux studies were conducted with cell monolayers on Transwell plates. 
  Endocytosis inhibitors had no effect on reducing R-123 accumulation with MePEG - -PCL . The apical to basolateral (AP→BL) flux of R-123 with MePEG - -PCL  or verapamil was similar to R-123 alone. However the BL→AP flux was significantly decreased with MePEG - -PCL  and verapamil. The efflux ratio for R-123 flux was 3.2 and was reduced to 1.06 with MePEG - -PCL  confirming the inhibition of P-glycoprotein (P-gp)-mediated efflux. R-123 accumulation at the conclusion of each of the flux experiments was similar for MePEG - -PCL  and verapamil in the BL→AP direction. The AP→BL direction demonstrated a 2-fold increase for verapamil and a 5-fold increase with MePEG - -PCL . This difference in R-123 accumulation was possibly due to the diblock enhancing passive membrane diffusion of R-123. 
  MePEG - -PCL  diblock reduced R-123 efflux through inhibition of P-gp efflux, and unimers may interact with cell membranes, increasing permeability and enhancing R-123 influx through increased transmembrane diffusion.",,,,2004

  Insulin detemir has been found in clinical trials to be absorbed with very low variability. A series of experiments were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. 
  The disappearance from an injected subcutaneous depot and elimination studies in plasma were carried out in pigs. Size-exclusion chromatography was used to assess the self-association and albumin binding states of insulin detemir and analogs. 
  Disappearance T  from the injection depot was 10.2 ± 1.2 h for insulin detemir and 2.0 ± 0.1 h for a monomeric acylated insulin analog. Self-association of acylated insulin analogs with same albumin affinity in saline correlated with disappearance rate and addition of albumin to saline showed a combination of insulin detemir self association and albumin binding. Intravenous kinetic studies showed that the clearance and volume of distribution decreased with increasing albumin binding affinity of different acylated insulin analogs. 
  The protracted action of detemir is primarily achieved through slow absorption into blood. Dihexamerization and albumin binding of hexameric and dimeric detemir prolongs residence time at the injection depot. Some further retention of detemir occurs in the circulation where albumin binding causes buffering of insulin concentration. Insulin detemir provides a novel principle of protraction, enabling increased predictability of basal insulin.",,,,2004

  To get a continuous description of the insertion and partition processes of sodium taurocholate (TC) into the lipid bilayers of vesicles that can serve as a model for understanding the mechanism of destabilization by the bile salts of liposomes used as drug carriers for oral administration. 
  The progressive solubilization of egg phosphatidylcholine vesicles during TC addition at controlled rates was followed by continuous turbidity (OD) and resonance energy transfer (RET) between two fluorescent probes. The influence of the lipid and TC concentrations as well as the rate of TC addition on the processes were examined. 
  Continuous turbidity recordings allowed following of the size and composition evolutions of the mixed TC/lipid aggregates formed at different steps of the vesicle-micelle transition. The solubilization mechanism is governed by complex kinetics that depend on the surfactant concentration and its addition rate. A two-step process characterizes the evolution of the vesicular state: interaction of TC molecules with the external monolayer of the vesicles first occurs. The homogeneous distribution of TC within the lipid matrix after its insertion is a very slow process. A micellar structural reorganization is observed when TC is added rapidly.

 . Radiolabeled CI-1040 was assessed for metabolism using rat and monkey liver microsomes and hepatocytes, as well as in Wistar rats and cynomolgus monkeys via oral administration. Human bile and plasma samples were obtained immediately after administration of CI-1040 to a patient with advanced colon cancer. A combination of HPLC-radiochromatography (HPLC-RAM), LC/MS and LC/MS/MS experiments were used to analyze all resulting metabolites. Unlabeled CI-1040 was administered (100 mg/day, QD) for 15 days to a patient suffering from colon cancer. Bile was collected by the insertion of a T-tube directly into the bile duct over a 14-h period. Metabolites were also monitored in the patient's plasma. 
 . Analysis of the metabolites in all species using   vitro and animal models demonstrated that CI-1040 undergoes extensive oxidative metabolism (14 metabolites identified) with subsequent glucuronidation of the hydroxylated metabolites. Metabolites were predominantly excreted through the bile in the animal models.

At 4°C (vs. 37°C), GlySar uptake was reduced by 95% in PEPT2  mice; no difference was observed in null animals. Unlabeled GlySar inhibited the uptake of [ C]GlySar in PEPT2  mice (p < 0.01); self-inhibition did not occur in PEPT2  mice. GlySar demonstrated saturable uptake in PEPT2  mice (V  = 16.4 pmol mg  min , K  = 70 μM, K  = 0.014 μl mg  min ), however, uptake was linear in PEPT2  mice (K  = 0.023 μl mg  min ). Low sodium buffer (1 mM) resulted in 75% and 59% reductions, respectively, in GlySar (p < 0.001) and 5-ALA (p < 0.01) uptake in PEPT2  mice; no differences were observed in PEPT2  mice. Overall, about 90-95% of the choroid plexus uptake of GlySar and 5-ALA was mediated by PEPT2, with about 5-10% of the residual uptake occurring by nonspecific mechanisms. 
 . The results demonstrate that PEPT2 is the only transporter responsible for the choroid plexus uptake of GlySar and 5-ALA. They also suggest a role for PEPT2 in the clearance of dipeptides and endogenous peptidomimetics from cerebrospinal fluid.",,,,2004

 . In this study, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) mediated efflux of simvastatin (SV), simvastatin acid (SVA), and atorvastatin (AVA) and inhibition of P-gp by SV, SVA, and AVA were evaluated to assess the role of P-gp in drug interactions. 
 . P-gp mediated efflux of SV, SVA, and AVA was determined by directional transport across monolayers of LLC-PK1 cells and LLC-PK1 cells transfected with human MDR1. Inhibition of P-gp was evaluated by studying the vinblastine efflux in Caco-2 cells and in P-gp overexpressing KBV1 cells at concentrations of SV, SVA, and AVA up to 50 μM. 
 . Directional transport studies showed insignificant P-gp mediated efflux of SV, and moderate P-gp transport [2.4-3.8 and 3.0-6.4 higher Basolateral (B) to Apical (A) than A to B transport] for SVA and AVA, respectively. Inhibition studies did not show the same trend as the transport studies with SV and AVA inhibiting P-gp (IC  ∼25-50 μM) but SVA not showing any inhibition of P-gp. 
 . The moderate level of P-gp mediated transport and low affinity of SV, SVA, and AVA for P-gp inhibition compared to systemic drug levels suggest that drug interactions due to competition for P-gp transport is unlikely to be a significant factor in adverse drug interactions. Moreover, the inconsistencies between P-gp inhibition studies and P-gp transport of SV, SVA, and AVA indicate that the inhibition studies are not a valid means to identify statins as Pgp substrates.",,,,2004

 . To develop paclitaxel carried by injectable PEGylated emulsions, an artificial neural network (ANN) was used to optimize the formulation—which has a small particle size, high entrapment efficiency, and good stability—and to investigate the role of each ingredient in the emulsion. 
 . Paclitaxel emulsions were prepared by a modified ethanol injection method. A computer optimization technique based on a spherical experimental design for three-level, three factors [soybean oil (X1), PEG-DSPE (X2) and polysorbate 80 (X3)] were used to optimize the formulation. The entrapment efficiency of paclitaxel (Y1) was quantified by HPLC; the particle size of the emulsions (Y2) was measured by dynamic laser light scattering and the stability of paclitaxel emulsions was monitored by the changes in drug concentration (Y3) and particle size (Y4) after storage at 4°C. 
 . The entrapment efficiency, particle size and stability of paclitaxel emulsions were influenced by PEG-DSPE, polysorbate 80, and soybean oil. Paclitaxel emulsions of small size (262 nm), high entrapment efficiency (96.7%), and good stability were obtained by the optimization. 
 . A novel formulation for paclitaxel emulsions was optimized with ANN and prepared. The contribution indices of each component suggested that PEG-DSPE mainly contributes to the entrapment efficiency and particle size of paclitaxel emulsions, while polysorbate 80 contributes to stability.",,,,2004

 . To develop an integrated model for microdialysis data that incorporates all data including the recovery measurements in one model, and to compare this model to a previous model and the results from a noncompartmental analysis. 
 . The models were developed in NONMEM. The modes of analysis were compared with respect to parameter estimates, model structures, gained mechanistic insight, and practical aspects. 
 . Both modeling approaches resulted in similar model structures. The parameter estimates in blood and brain from the models and the results from the noncompartmental analysis were comparable. Using the integrated model all data, that is, the total arterial concentrations, the venous and brain dialysate concentrations, and the recovery measurements, were analyzed simultaneously. 
 . The theoretical benefits of the integrated model are related to the inclusion of the recovery in the model and the use of all collected data as it was observed. Thus, all data are described in a single model, corrections for the recovery and the protein binding are done within the model, and the dialysate observations are described by the integral over each collection interval. Thereby, the variability and the uncertainty in the model parameters are handled correctly to give more reliable parameter estimates.",,,,2004

Bond dissociation energies (BDEs) calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-31G(d) level with isodesmic corrections were used to predict sites of autoxidation. In addition, frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory at the Hartree-Fock level was used to predict sites of peroxide oxidation and electron transfer.

 . The computational BDEs and FMO analysis of   was consistent with the LC/UV/MS/MS data and allowed for structural proposals, which were confirmed by LC/MS/NMR. The autoxidation conditions yielded a number of degradants not observed under peroxide degradation while formal stability conditions gave both peroxide and autoxidation degradants. 
 . Electronic structure methods were successfully applied in combination with LC/UV/MS/MS to predict degradation pathways and assist in spectral identification. The degradation and excipient stability studies highlight the importance of including both peroxide and autoxidation conditions in forced degradation studies.",,,,2004

  The depth-resolved pattern of aminolevulinic acid (ALA) concentration in excised vaginal tissue was determined after   application of an ALA-loaded bioadhesive patch. From this data, the tissue concentration of ALA achievable at a specified depth from the surface could be related to the concentration needed to elicit a photodynamic effect in a model gynecological tumor cell line (HeLa). 
  Excised vaginal tissue was mounted in a modified Franz diffusion cell and exposed to a water-soluble, ALA-loaded, bioadhesive patch. After a period of time, the tissue was cryostatically sectioned and the stratal concentration of radiolabeled ALA determined using scintillation spectroscopy. HeLa cells were cultured in media containing specific concentrations of ALA and exposed to standard photodynamic protocols of light exposure. 
  An ALA concentration of 65.6 mM was achievable at 2.375 mm from the tissue surface after application of ALA-loaded patch. The photodynamic effectiveness of this concentration was demonstrated in HeLa with exposure to concentrations exceeding 1.0 mM ALA bringing about reductions in viable cell numbers by 90%. An enhancement of PpIX production using adjunctive EDTA over the clinically relevant 4 h application time interval was shown to be minimal in HeLa. Instead, PpIX production was more closely correlated with ALA concentration, with 100 mM ALA producing approximately 3100 ng PpIX mg  protein in the same time period. 
  Given that vaginal intraepithelial neoplasias can extend to 2.0 mm from the lesion surface, the ALA permeability derived from a bioadhesive patch is sufficient to induce photosensitization suitable for light induced destruction at deep sites of this type of lesion.",,,,2004

  In order to improve the   and   efficacy of an integrin antagonist (IA) of the extracellular domain of the αvβ3 integrin, a receptor upregulated on tumor neovasculature, the IA was attached to the surface of a dextran-coated liposome (DCL). IA-DCLs were characterized  , and the pharmacokinetic and anti-tumor properties were assessed  . 
  The   binding properties were measured with purified integrin, endothelial cells, and melanoma cells. The pharmacokinetic parameters were measured in healthy mice with  C-labeled IA-DCLs and anti-tumor efficacy was assessed with the M21 human melanoma xenograft mouse model. 
 
 , IC  values for IA-DCLs and IA are similar, and IA-DCLs inhibit cell proliferation relative to controls. IA-DCLs are stable in serum, and the pharmacokinetic half-life in mice is 23 h. In the M21/mouse model, statistically significant inhibition of tumor growth was observed for mice treated with IA-DCLs, whereas controls including saline, DCLs lacking IA, and cyclo(RGDfV) were ineffective. Increased apoptosis and a reduction in vessel counts relative to controls were present in tumors from animals treated with IA-DCLs.

 . Xenobiotic transporters have been proposed to be involved in membrane penetration of various therapeutic agents. As little information is available on molecular mechanism of their functional regulation, we have attempted to clarify the protein-protein interactions of such transporters as a first step to identify their regulators. 
 . Yeast two-hybrid screening was performed to examine the interaction between carboxylic terminus of various xenobiotic transporters and PDZ (PSD95, Dlg and ZO1) domain-containing proteins. The interaction and functional regulation were also evaluated in pull-down, immunoprecipitation and transport studies. 
 . Specific interaction with PDZ proteins was identified for several xenobiotic transporters including PEPT1, PEPT2, OCT3, OCTN1, OCTN2, OAT4, OATP-A, OATP-D, and OATP-F. The potent interaction was observed between PEPT2 and PDZK1, and deletion of the last four amino acids of the PEPT2 C-terminus almost completely abrogated such interaction. Recombinant PEPT2 C-terminus fusion protein can bind to purified His -tagged PDZK1, confirming the involvement of two of four PDZ domains within PDZK1 in the interaction. Alanine-scanning mutation in PEPT2 revealed the presence of a consensus sequence (-T-X-L) that is responsible for the PDZK1 interaction. Transfection of PDZK1 increased the uptake of glycylsarcosine by PEPT2, whereas such stimulation was not observed for PEPT2 with the last four amino acids deleted. 
 . These results first identified the interaction between PDZ proteins and the cytosolic tail of various xenobiotic transporters. PDZK1 directly interacts with PEPT2, exerting functional regulation of its transporting activity. The current findings imply the localization of PEPT2 within a protein network constructed from PDZK1 and other transporter proteins.",,,,2004

  The aim of the current study was to identify the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP/ABCG2) on its localization, expression level, and transport activity. 
  The cellular localization was identified using the wild type and seven different SNP variants of BCRP (V12M, Q141K, A149P, R163K, Q166E, P269S, and S441N BCRP) after transfection of their cDNAs in plasmid vector to LLC-PK1 cells. Their expression levels and transport activities were determined using the membrane vesicles from HEK293 cells infected with the recombinant adenoviruses containing these kinds of BCRP cDNAs. 
  Wild type and six different SNP variants of BCRP other than S441N BCRP were expressed on the apical membrane, whereas S441N BCRP showed intracellular localization. The expression levels of Q141K and S441N BCRP proteins were significantly lower compared with the wild type and the other five variants. Furthermore, the transport activity of E S, DHEAS, MTX, and PAH normalized by the expression level of BCRP protein was almost the same for the wild type, V12M, Q141K, A149P, R163K, Q166E, and P269S BCRP. 
  These results suggest that Q141K SNPs may associate with a lower expression level, and S441N SNPs may affect both the expression level and cellular localization. It is possible that subjects with these polymorphisms may have lower expression level of BCRP protein and, consequently, a reduced ability to export these substrates.",,,,2004

 . Extracts made from berries, herbs, and various plant materials, which might possess a range of activities, are used as health promoting products. Because little is known about their effects on the absorption of co-administered drugs, the effects of some food supplements, Finnish berries, and herbs were studied on the permeability of some commonly used drugs. 
 . The permeabilities of verapamil, metoprolol, ketoprofen, paracetamol, and furosemide were studied across Caco-2 cell monolayers with contemporaneously administered extracts from flax seed, purple loosestrife, and Scots pine bark; bilberries, cowberries, and raspberries; oregano, rosemary, and sage. Toxicological tests were conducted to determine cellular damage. 
 . The effects of extracts on drug permeabilities were generally minor. Flax seed decreased the permeability of all drugs except verapamil. Purple loosestrife and pine decreased verapamil and metoprolol permeability. Changes caused by berries were mainly pH-related. Rosemary and oregano enhanced furosemide permeability. 
 . Ingestion of extracts of herbs and berries studied are not expected to markedly change the permeabilities of highly permeable drugs. Harmful effects at sites of or during absorption are unlikely. However, if high doses of extracts are administered with low permeable drugs  effects on drug permeabilities could not be excluded. Use of such extracts should therefore be evaluated during continuous medication.",,,,2004

  The Caco-2 association of lectin-grafted PLGA-nanospheres was investigated compared to plain and BSA-coated spheres. 
  Nanospheres made from fluorescent-labeled PLGA were coated with wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) or BSA and incubated with Caco-2 monolayers varying the concentration of nanospheres, the time, and the temperature. The tests were performed in a static horizontal as well as an aerated vertical setup to find out the system most appropriate for estimation of bioadhesion. 
  Due to bioadhesive effects, WGA-modified particles exhibited highest association to the cells as compared to plain and BSA-coated ones. The amount of associated spheres increased with time and concentration of the nanosphere suspension. Whereas the binding of lectin-coated spheres was independent from energy, their uptake was energy consuming as opposed to BSA and plain nanospheres, which exhibited nonspecific, energy independent binding and uptake. Although more particles were associated with the monolayer in the horizontal setup than in the vertical system, the vertical system reflects true bioadhesion due to circulation of the spheres which inhibits the influence of sedimentation. 
  Immobilization of WGA considerably enhances the binding as well as the uptake of PLGA-nanospheres by Caco-2 monolayers. For bioadhesion studies, the vertical setup is recommended instead of the horizontal setup.",,,,2004

  Functional analysis of the three recombinant human serum albumin (rHSA) domains and their potential as stand-alone proteins for use as drug delivery protein carriers. 
  Protein structure was examined by fluorescence and CD spectroscopy. Ligand binding was estimated by ultrafiltration. Antioxidant activity was estimated by measuring the quenching of dihydrorhodamine 123. Esterase-like activity and enolase-like activity were estimated from the rate of hydrolysis of  -nitrophenyl acetate and conversion of dihydrotestosterone from the 3-keto to 3-enol form, respectively. The domains of human serum albumin (HSA) were radiolabeled with  In to evaluate their pharmacokinetics. 
  The ligand binding ability of subsites Ia and Ib could not be detected in domain II. However, the binding of ligands to subsite Ic and site II were preserved in domain II and domain III, respectively. Domain III retained about 45% of its esterase-like activity, and weaker esterase-like activity was also observed in domain I. All domains showed low enolase-like activity in a pH 7.4 phosphate buffer, but domain II had higher activity in a pH 9.2 carbonate buffer. Domain I exhibited antioxidant activity comparable to that of rHSA. All three of the  In-radiolabeled domains were rapidly eliminated from HSA, with high accumulation in the kidneys.

  i) To develop novel approaches for the construction of bioequivalence (BE) limits incorporating both the intrasubject variability and the geometric mean ratio (GMR), and ii) to assess the performance of the novel approaches in comparison to several scaled BE procedures and the classic unscaled average BE. 
  Plots of the BE limits or the extreme GMR values accepted as a function of the coefficient of variation (CV) were constructed for published and the developed scaled procedures. Two-period crossover BE investigations with 12, 24, or 36 subjects were simulated with assumptions of a CV 10%, 20%, 30%, or 40%. The decline in the percentage of accepted studies was recorded as the true GMR for the two formulations was raised from 1.00 to 1.50. Acceptance of BE was evaluated by published and the developed scaled procedures, and, for comparison, by the unscaled average BE. 
  Two GMR-dependent BE limits are proposed for the evaluation of average BE: i) BELscG1 with Ln(Upper, Lower BE limit) = ±[(5 − 4GMR)0.496s + Ln(1.25)], and ii) BELscG2 with Ln(Upper, Lower BE limit) = ±[(3 - 2GMR)(0.496s + Ln(1.25))], where s is the square root of the intrasubject variance. The range of BE limits becomes narrower as GMR values deviate from unity, and increases with variability. The two new approaches exhibit the highest statistical power at low CV values. At high levels of variability, BELscG1 and BELscG2 show high statistical power, as well as the lowest percentages of acceptance among the scaled methods when GMR = 1.25. The latter becomes more obvious when a large number of subjects is incorporated in the studies. 
  The GMR and CV estimates of the BE study can be used in conjunction with the GMR vs. CV plot for the assessment of average BE. The new approaches, BELscG1 and BELscG2, appear to be highly effective at all levels of variation investigated.",,,,2004

 . Baicalin (BG) and its aglycone, baicalein (B), are strong antioxidants and have various pharmacological actions. The purpose of this study was to evaluate efflux of BG from rat intestinal mucosal cell following glucuronidation of B absorbed after oral administration of B. 
 . The absorption and excretion of BG and B were evaluated in rats using the   jejunal loop technique and   jejunal everted sac experiments. BG and B levels were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with electro-chemical detection to ensure selectivity and high sensitivity. 
 . A large amount (30.4% recovery) of BG, but no B, was detected in the intestinal lumens of germ-free rats 4 h after oral administration of B (12.1 mg/kg), in comparison with a substantial recovery (55.1%) of unabsorbed BG 4 h after its administration. During the   rat jejunal loop absorption experiment, B disappeared rapidly, and 8% of the lost B was excreted into the loop as BG 20 min after infusing 0.1 mM B. In an   absorption experiment using everted rat jejunal sac, BG also appeared outside the sac, accompanied by the disappearance of B from the outer (mucosal) side. However, very little of B was transferred to the inner (serosal) side of the sac, and only a trace of BG was detected inside the sac. Thus, in both the loop and the everted sac systems, the efflux of BG from the mucosal surface was saturated with the concentration of B added. Moreover, the efflux rate of BG in the everted jejunal sac from Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rat (EHBR) was significantly lower by 56.4% than that from Sprague-Dawley rat.

 . Enalapril may undergo the thermal-induced intramolecular interaction to cause an enalapril diketopiperazine (DKP) formation. It is interesting to study the influence of Eudragit E, as a coating polymer, on the stability of enalapril maleate. The reaction kinetics of the solid-state degradation process of pure enalapril maleate and Eudragit E/enalapril maleate mixture with different weight ratios were examined. The mechanism of solid-state interaction between Eudragit E and enalapril maleate was also discussed. 
 . The cast samples of pure enalapril maleate or Eudragit E/enalapril maleate mixture after evaporating the solvent were prepared on an aluminum foil and also determined by reflectance Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) microspectroscopy equipped with thermal analyzer. 
 . The result indicates that the interaction might occur between enalapril maleate and Eudragit E in the solid state after evaporating the solvent. The thermal-dependent FTIR spectra show that not only the formation of DKP but also the six-membered cyclic anhydride occurred in the enalapril maleate/Eudragit E mixture in the heating process. Two pathways for solid-sate interaction were proposed. The stability of enalapril maleate was dependent on the weight ratio of enalapril maleate and Eudragit E. The activation energy (n = 3) of DKP formation for pure enalapril maleate was about 141.2 ± 0.7 kJ/mol, but it was reduced significantly to 86.7 ± 0.8 kJ/mol after interaction with Eudragit E (weight ratio: 1:1), suggesting Eudragit E might exacerbate the degradation of enalapril maleate. However, the degradation accelerated by Eudragit E was reduced in high content of Eudragit E. 
 . When the weight ratio of both components was 1:1, Eudragit E might interact with the carboxyl group of maleic acid to exacerbate the degradation of enalapril maleate. However, the excess amount of Eudragit E might somewhat reduce the degradation of enalapril, due to the interaction that occurred between Eudragit E and carboxyl group of enalapril.",,,,2004

In this study, we investigated the antitumor mechanisms of polycarpine and its synthetic derivative, desmethoxyethoxy-polycarpine (dimethylpolycarpine), through the induction of apoptosis. This new knowledge regarding the proapoptotic action of polycarpine and dimethylpolycarpine should lead to a better understanding of their effects and development of a new class of anticancer drugs. Apoptosis was clearly observed by flow cytometry and Western blotting using an antibody against cleaved caspase-3 as an apoptotic marker. Polycarpines differentially activated p38 kinase, JNKs, and ERKs in JB6 Cl 41 cells. The polycarpines-induced apoptosis was decreased in cells expressing a dominant-negative mutant of JNK. Both compounds stimulated p53-dependent transcriptional activity and phosphorylation. Induction of p53-phosphorylation at serine 15 was suppressed in JNK1 and JNK2 knockout cells. Furthermore, polycarpines were unable to induce apoptosis in p53-deficient MEFs in contrast to a strong induction of apoptosis in wild type MEFs, suggesting that p53 is involved in apoptosis induced by polycarpines. The p53 phosphorylation in turn was mediated by activated JNKs. These results indicate that all three MAPK signaling pathways are involved in the response of JB6 cells to treatment with polycarpines. Evidence also supports a proapoptotic role of the JNKs signaling pathway   and clearly indicates that JNKs are required for phosphorylation of c-Jun, activation of p53, and subsequent apoptosis induced by polycarpines.","epidermal growth factor extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases fetal bovine serum c-Jun NH -terminal kinases mitogen-activated protein kinases minimum essential medium polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis bis[2-amino-4-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1-methyl-5-imidazolyl]disulfide dihydrochloride TPA, 12- -tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate",,,2004

Caco-2 cells digested the polysorbate 80 to liberate oleic acid, which was used by the cells to enhance basolateral secretion of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins including chylomicrons.

Inhibition of lipoprotein secretion by Cremophor EL in Caco-2 cells was reversed by co-administration with polysorbate 80. Polysorbate 80 promoted chylomicron secretion in Caco-2 cells and counteracted the inhibitory effects of other surfactants. These properties, in tandem with its P-gp inhibitory activity, make polysorbate 80 an ideal excipient for lymphotrophic vehicles.

Liposomes were prepared and the retention factors were measured for a series of basic drugs under a variety of buffer conditions, including various buffer types, concentrations, and ionic strengths as well as using different phospholipids and liposome compositions. LEKC retention is compared with octanol-water partitioning. The interaction of ionizable solutes with liposomes decreased with increasing ionic strength of the aqueous buffer. The type of buffer also influences positively charged drug partitioning into liposomes. Varying the surface charge on the liposomes by the selection of phospholipids influences the electrostatic interactions, causing an increase in retention with increasing percentages of anionic lipids in the membrane. Poor correlations are observed between LEKC retention and octanol-water partitioning. These studies demonstrate the overall buffer ionic strength at a given pH is more important than buffer type and concentration. The interaction of positively charged drugs with charged lipid bilayer membranes is selectively influenced by the pK  of the drug. Liposomes are more biologically relevant   models for cell membranes than octanol, and LEKC provides a unique combination of advantages for rapid screening of drug-membrane interactions.",,,,2004

Increasing concentrations of either Fungizone or ABELCET  (1.25–12.5 μg AmpB/ml) were incubated with HDL and [3H]CE-LDL or [3H]CE-HDL and LDL (the amount of each fraction added was equivalent to 10 μg of cholesterol) and LTP I in delipidated human plasma at 37∘C for 90 min. As a positive control, TP2, a monoclonal antibody directed against LTP-1, was added instead of drug. After incubation, manganese and phosphate reagents were then added to precipitate out all of the LDL. The supernatant, consisted of only HDL, was counted for radioactivity to determine the amount of CE transferred from LDL. Similarly, the precipitate consisted of only LDL, was counted for radioactivity to determine the amount of CE transferred from HDL. For Fungizone, the transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) between HDL and LDL were not significantly different compared to nontreated controls. For ABELCET , CE transfer from HDL to LDL was significantly decreased at 12.5 μg AmpB/ml compared to control. However, transfer from LDL to HDL was not significantly different compared to non-treated controls. Similar results were observed with the major lipid component of ABELCET , dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine. CE transfer from HDL to LDL and LDL to HDL was significantly decreased when using the positive control (TP2). Fungizone does not affect LTP I–mediated transfer of CE between HDL and LDL. ABELCET  inhibits transfer from HDL to LDL, but has no effect on CE transfer from LDL to HDL. This uni-directional inhibition may contribute to the high recovery of AmpB in HDL but the very low presence of drug in the LDL fraction following ABELCET  incubation.","amphotericin B lipid complex lipid transfer protein I cholesteryl ester triglyceride amphotericin B high-density lipoproteins low-density lipoproteins triglyceride-rich lipoproteins monoclonal antibody directed against lipid transfer protein I lipoprotein deficient plasma ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay phosphate buffered saline carboxy-methylcellulose egg phosphatidylcholine constant, fraction of label transferred time dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol",,,2004

APGs belong to the class of nonionic surfactants and are mixtures of molecules consisting of a hydrocarbon chain with   carbon atoms linked to   sugar residues. Physicochemical properties of APG products strongly depend on the molecular composition. Therefore, a detailed analytical investigation of technical-grade APGs is presented. Complex mixtures of alkyl/alkenyl polyglycosides (APGs, Plantacare) and mixtures of APGs with other surfactants were analyzed by reversed-phase liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/ESI-QTOF-MS) using methanol-water as mobile phase and gradient elution. Analytes were separated according to the chain length of the alkyl homologs. Under the soft ionization of the ESI technique, mainly [M+Na]  ions were observed, which proved to be very stable. Additionally [M+H]  ions were detected. The QTOF mass spectrometer allows to identify even high molecular mass components in the mixtures, and APGs up to eight sugar residues were found.

Using MS/MS experiments, additional structural and chemical information was obtained.

237,,,[],"To characterize complex coacervates/flocculates of lysozyme and heparin in terms of binding stoichiometry and to determine the effect of complexation on protein structure and stability. Insoluble lysozyme-heparin complexes were formed at pH 7.2 and the binding stoichiometry determined using a solution depletion method. Protein structure was determined by infrared spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence. Protein stability was evaluated using differential scanning calorimetry and followed in a 12-weeks storage stability study at 37∘C. Binding stoichiometry between heparin and lysozyme was found to be dependent on ionic strength of the solution. At low ionic strength (I ≈0.01) about 11 lysozyme molecules could bind to a 17 kDa heparin chain, 3 to a 6 kDa chain, and less than 2 to a 3 kDa chain. At higher ionic strength (I ≈0.1), only 7 lysozyme molecules could bind to a 18 kDa heparin chain.. Above ionic strengths of approximately 0.32 M, no insoluble complexes were observed. Infrared spectroscopy and intrinsic fluorescence did not show any major changes in protein structure upon complexation to heparin. In contrast, differential scanning calorimetry showed a large decrease in the melting temperature of the protein, from 77∘C to 61∘C. Moreover, after 12-weeks storage at 37∘C, only 60% protein recovery was observed for the complexes, with no loss of protein for the uncomplexed protein. Heparin has multiple binding sites for lysozyme, amounting to at most one lysozyme molecule per 3 disaccharide units of heparin. Complexation decreased lysozyme stability, suggesting that heparin has a higher affinity for the unfolded state than the native state. Similar destabilization may occur for other proteins upon interaction with highly charged polymeric compounds or surfaces.",,,,2004
238,,,[],"To group microcrystalline celluloses (MCCs) using a combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and data clustering. Radial basis function (RBF) network was used to model the torque measurements of the various MCCs. Output from the RBF network was used to group the MCCs using a data clustering technique known as discrete incremental clustering (DIC). Rheological or torque profiles of various MCCs at different combinations of mixing time and water:MCC ratios were obtained using mixer torque rheometry (MTR). Correlation analysis was performed on the derived torque parameter Torque  and physical properties of the MCCs. Depending on the leniency of the predefined threshold parameters, the 11 MCCs can be assigned into 2 or 3 groups. Grouping results were also able to identify bulk and tapped densities as major factors governing water-MCC interaction. MCCs differed in their water retentive capacities whereby the denser Avicel PH 301 and PH 302 were more sensitive to the added water. An objective grouping of MCCs can be achieved with a combination of ANN and DIC. This aids in the preliminary assessment of new or unknown MCCs. Key properties that control the performance of MCCs in their interactions with water can be discovered.",,,,2004
239,,,[],"To evaluate the effect of hydrophilic cyclodextrins (CyDs) on the aggregation induced by different stresses and on the oxidation and deamidation of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH). The aggregation of rhGH was induced by three denaturing techniques including chemical (4.5 M guanidine hydrochloride), thermal (differential scanning calorimetry), and interfacial denaturation (vortex agitation). The aggregates were characterized and quantified by UV spectrophotometry and size exclusion chromatography. The effects of hydrophilic CyDs on deamidation and oxidation rates of rhGH were studied by HPLC method. In both thermally and chemically induced aggregations, branched β-CyDs significantly inhibited the aggregation of rhGH compared with the other α- and γ-CyDs. This can explain that the β-CyD cavity with branched sugar moieties may be relatively preferable in preventing the aggregation of rhGH. In contrast, 2-hydroxypropyl β-CyD with surface activity was found to be effective in reducing the aggregation induced by interfacial denaturation compared with those of branched β-CyDs. On the other hand, these hydrophilic CyDs showed no noticeable inhibitory effect on the oxidation and deamidation rates of rhGH. The results suggested that CyDs interact preferably with exposed hydrophobic side chains rather than aliphatic side chains of rhGH, resulting in the inhibition of aggregation but not the oxidation and deamidation rates. The different inhibitory effect of CyDs is dependent not only on the structure and property of CyD itself but also the nature of the denaturing stimulus. The current results suggested that hydrophilic β-CyDs can effectively inhibit the aggregation of rhGH. Thus, hydrophilic β-CyDs may be potentially useful excipients for parenteral preparation of rhGH.",,,,2004

The rates of oxidation of methionine residues in G-CSF were determined by peptide mapping analyses, and the oxidation of methionine residue in hPTH 13-34 was quantified by reverse-phase HPLC. At pH 4.5, free methionine reduces, glutathione and acetylcysteine have no obvious effect on, and AscH  promotes the rates of oxidation of methionine residues in G-CSF. The H O -induced oxidation rate constants for free methionine, acetylcysteine, and glutathione at pH 4.5 were measured to be 32.07, 1.00, and 1.63 M h , respectively, while the oxidation rate constant for Met , the most readily oxidizable methionine residue in G-CSF, is 13.95 M h . Therefore, the different effects of free methionine, acetylcysteine, and glutathione on the rates of oxidation of methionine residues in G-CSF are consistent with their different reactivity toward oxidation by H O . By using hPTH 13-34, the effect of AscH  on the H O -induced oxidation of methionine residue was quantified, and the mechanisms involved were proposed. Because of the presence of trace transition metal ions in solution, at low concentrations, AscH  is prone to be a prooxidant, increasing the hydroxyl radical (⋅OH) production rate via Fenton-type reactions. In addition to peroxide oxidation, these radicals lead to the degradation of hPTH 13-34 to smaller peptide fragments. At high concentrations, AscH  tends to act as an ⋅OH scavenger. EDTA inhibits ⋅OH production and thus eliminates the degradation of hPTH 13-34 by forming complexes with transition metal ions. However, the rate of oxidation of the methionine residue in hPTH 13-34 increases as the concentration of AscH  is increased from 0 to 200 mM, and the reason for this is still not clear. Our results demonstrate that free methionine is an effective antioxidant to protect G-CSF against methionine oxidation at pH 4.5. Acetylcysteine and glutathione are not effective antioxidants at pH 4.5. Their oxidation rates at different pH values imply that they would be much more effective antioxidants than free methionine at alkaline conditions. AscH  is a powerful electron donor. It acts as a prooxidant in the conditions in this study and is unlikely to prevent oxidation by H O  in protein formulation, whether or not EDTA is present.",,,,2004

The preparation of microparticles consisted in dissolving polymer in glycofurol. This solution was emulsified in a vegetable oil, and then amphiphilic agent was added into the emulsion to extract glycofurol and lead to microparticle formation. Physicochemical studies were carried out, and an experimental design was prepared in order to elucidate the impact of the formulation composition on the microparticle characteristics. Finally, encapsulation tests were made with a model protein. In a ternary diagram, a small feasibility area allowing particle formation was located. The resulting microparticles were spherical with a homogeneous, polymeric matrix structure. They exhibited a variable size from 3 to 15 μm, which was controlled by the different formulation parameters. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis made it possible to detect their composition. Preliminary results showed that these particles were able to encapsulate a protein model, lysozyme. This simple and convenient technique enabled us to obtain spherical, biodegradable microparticles from acceptable excipients.

Depositions of salbutamol sulfate from two nebulizers in two models, one with constriction at the oropharynx (the constricted cast) and another model without that constriction (the wide cast), were determined. For the Sidestream and Ventstream nebulizer, 76 ± 3% (mean ± standard deviation) and 81 ± 2% of the emitted dose deposited in the constricted cast, whereas 51 ± 2% and 49 ± 3% of the emitted dose deposited in the wide cast, respectively. These values were in good agreement with   data. Mostly, increasing nebulizer charge volume (by normal saline) from 2.5 ml to 5 ml increased significantly the lung dose. However, the lung doses from the Sidestream and Ventstream nebulizer with 2.5 ml charge volume via the wide cast were (1.37 ± 0.06 and 1.38 ± 0.05 mg) significantly larger than those for the constricted cast with 5 ml charge volume (0.87 ± 0.15 and 0.86 ± 0.21 mg, respectively) (p = 0.005).

An attempt was also made to explain the molecular interaction within the gel systems from a molecular conformational approach. Nonaqueous gel matrices were prepared from three fine particle grades of ethylcellulose and propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate. Continuous and oscillatory shear rheometry was performed using a cone-and-plate rheometer and mechanical characterization was performed using a universal tensile tester. The gel matrices exhibited prominent viscoelastic behaviour, yield stress and thixotropy. Rheological and mechanical properties showed significant upward trends with increased polymeric chain length and polymer concentrations. Good linear correlations were obtained between rheological and mechanical properties. The solvent molecular conformation was found to play a role in affecting the formation of gel networks via intermolecular hydrogen bonding between ethylcellulose polymer chains. Ethylcellulose was successfully formulated as a nonaqueous gel with propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate. The novel nonaqueous gel exhibited rheological profiles corresponding to a physically cross-linked three dimensional gel network, with suitable mechanical characteristics for use as a vehicle for topical drug delivery.

250,,,[],"To develop a procedure based on manometric temperature measurement (MTM) and an “expert system” for good practices in freeze drying that will allow development of an optimized freeze-drying process during a single laboratory freeze-drying experiment. Freeze drying was performed with a FTS Dura-Stop/Dura-Top freeze dryer with the manometric temperature measurement software installed. Five percent solutions of glycine, sucrose, or mannitol with 2 ml to 4 ml fill in 5 ml vials were used, with all vials loaded on one shelf. Details of freezing, optimization of chamber pressure, target product temperature, and some aspects of secondary drying are determined by the expert system algorithms. MTM measurements were used to select the optimum shelf temperature, to determine drying end points, and to evaluate residual moisture content in real-time. MTM measurements were made at 1 hour or half-hour intervals during primary drying and secondary drying, with a data collection frequency of 4 points per second. The improved MTM equations were fit to pressure-time data generated by the MTM procedure using Microcal Origin software to obtain product temperature and dry layer resistance. Using heat and mass transfer theory, the MTM results were used to evaluate mass and heat transfer rates and to estimate the shelf temperature required to maintain the target product temperature. MTM product dry layer resistance is accurate until about two-thirds of total primary drying time is over, and the MTM product temperature is normally accurate almost to the end of primary drying provided that effective thermal shielding is used in the freeze-drying process. The primary drying times can be accurately estimated from mass transfer rates calculated very early in the run, and we find the target product temperature can be achieved and maintained with only a few adjustments of shelf temperature. The freeze-dryer overload conditions can be estimated by calculation of heat/mass flow at the target product temperature. It was found that the MTM results serve as an excellent indicator of the end point of primary drying. Further, we find that the rate of water desorption during secondary drying may be accurately measured by a variation of the basic MTM procedure. Thus, both the end point of secondary drying and real-time residual moisture may be obtained during secondary drying. Manometric temperature measurement and the expert system for good practices in freeze drying does allow development of an optimized freeze-drying process during a single laboratory freeze-drying experiment.",,,,2005

In order to gain an understanding of the relation between structure and compact properties, analyzing the structure in a location dependent manner would be extremely useful. Our aim was to visualize and to quantitatively analyze the pore distribution in compacts. This was done by embedding a cubic (sodium chloride) compact with polymer, allowing the compact to be cut without disrupting the structure. By doing so, it was possible to make scanning electron microscopic images from different angles at different locations in the compact. These images were made binary with a two-means cluster algorithm (Isodata) after which the porosity could be calculated. Counting the number of transitions from the pixels in the pores to the pixels in the sodium chloride particles in two perpendicular directions allows us to construct a measure for the anisotropic connectivity of the particles. The results show an increase in porosity toward the bottom of the compact and showed a preferred orientation of the pores in the direction of compression. The proposed method is suitable for analyzing the pore distribution quantitatively and for evaluating anisotropy.",glycol methacrylate scanning electron microscope,,,2005

Accordingly, inhibition of intestinal sulfation may lead to an increase in the bioavailability of ritodrine. In this study, we aimed to investigate the activities of ritodrine sulfation by SULT1A1, which is expressed predominantly in the liver, and SULT1A3, which is expressed predominantly in the intestine, as well as the inhibitory effects of beverages on their activities. We investigated ritodrine sulfation by using recombinant human sulfotransferase (SULT) 1A1 and SULT1A3 in an   study. Next, we investigated the inhibitory effects of grapefruit juice, orange juice, green tea, and black tea on ritodrine sulfation. Sulfation of ritodrine by SULT1A3 was much higher than that by SULT1A1, suggesting that the bioavailability of ritodrine may be limited by intestinal SULT1A3. The ritodrine sulfation activities of SULT1A1 and SULT1A3 were significantly inhibited by all beverages examined at a concentration of 10%. Green tea and black tea exhibited potent inhibition; even at a concentration of 5%, they both inhibited SULT1A1 by 100% and SULT1A3 by ≥95%.

Based on the structural study of VEGF, we developed a novel cyclopeptide (cyclo-VEGI) that exhibits powerful antitumor properties. We herein report the design of novel molecules derived from cyclo-VEGI as potential targeting agents in cancer and other angiogenesis-related diseases. We performed selective chemical modification of the most active VEGF-derived cyclopeptide (cyclo-VEGI). Original hydrophilic linkers were synthesized and coupled to cyclo-VEGI. These reactions provide nanocarriers for delivery. The inhibitory effect of the different compounds on VEGF binding was evaluated in competition assays with  I-VEGF. A fluorescent cyclo-VEGI peptide was synthezised to assess direct binding and internalization of cyclo-VEGI. Chemical modifications of cyclo-VEGI do not diminish the biological activity of cyclo-VEGI as measured in competition assays; in fact, it is even increased. Moreover there is a strong cellular accumulation of the fluorescent-labeled cyclo-VEGI. Conjugates synthesized in this study may be useful leads to design delivery systems for targeting approaches in cancer and other angiogenesis-related diseases.

In the present work, we investigated whether zinc sulfate would inhibit other bitter-tasting compounds and pharmaceuticals. The utility of zinc as a general bitterness inhibitor is compromised, however, by the fact that it is also a good sweetness inhibitor [R. S. J. Keast, T. Canty, and P. A. S. Breslin. Oral zinc sulfate solutions inhibit sweet taste perception.    :513–521 (2004)] and would interfere with the taste of complex formulations.

The thermal behavior of frozen mannitol–sucrose solutions   and after annealing, in the absence and presence of the protein, were characterized by low-temperature powder X-ray diffractometry and differential scanning calorimetry. The influence of the protein on the crystallization behavior of mannitol was also evaluated.

At fixed excipient compositions, the protein had no effect on the  ′ if the protein concentration was ≤20 mg/ml. However, at higher protein concentrations, there was a marked increase in  ′ as a function of protein concentration. The inhibitory effect of the protein on mannitol crystallization was concentration dependent and was directly evident from X-ray diffractometry experiments. Annealing facilitated both mannitol nucleation and crystal growth even in the presence of the protein. The ratio of mannitol to sucrose and the protein concentration have an impact on the  ′ and may therefore influence the primary drying temperature.

The particles were obtained both in a batch or a continuous manner in the form of aqueous nanosuspensions. Precipitation of CA nanoparticles was used for conducting a mechanistic study on particle size control and scale-up. GF and MA nanoparticles were produced in several batches to compare their dissolution behavior with that of micronized materials. The physical analysis of the particles produced was performed using dynamic light scattering (particle size), scanning electron microscopy (morphology), powder X-ray diffraction (crystallinity), gas chromatography (residual solvent), and a dissolution apparatus. Particles with mean volume diameter ranging between 100 and 1000 nm were consistently produced. The emulsion droplet size, drug solution concentration, and organic solvent content in the emulsion were the major parameters responsible for particle size control. Efficient and fast extraction, down to low parts-per-million levels, was achieved with supercritical CO . The GF and MA nanoparticles produced were crystalline in nature and exhibited a 5- to 10-fold increase in the dissolution rate compared with that of micronized powders. Theoretical calculations indicated that this dissolution was governed mainly by the surface kinetic coefficient and the specific surface area of the particles produced. It was observed that the necessary condition for a reliable and scalable process was the sufficient emulsion stability during the extraction time. The method developed offers a viable alternative to both the milling and constructive nanoparticle formation processes.

MPEG–PDLLA diblock copolymers with a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) feature were synthesized by using a ring-opening polymerization method.

Wet granulation also reduced compactibility of MCC to different degrees. Overgranulated batch with HPC showed the lowest compactibility and was less compactible than the batch without HPC granulated using the same parameters. Ball-milled material showed an increase in porosity and was significantly more compactible than the unmilled granulation from the same batch. The decrease in MCC compactibility after granulation is associated with the decrease in MCC primary particle porosity and in some cases with the formation of large dense granules as well. Under certain conditions, milling seems to counteract the effect of wet granulation on MCC compactibility.",,,,2006

NIR spectra were collected from each of the following: EN and 4-CP powders, EN and 4-CP in solution, and skin samples following topical exposure to either 4-CP in water or EN in propylene glycol and topical creams. To predict drug concentration from NIR spectra, principal component regression (PCR), interval PCR, and uninformative variable elimination PCR were each used with a leave-one-out cross-validation, and results were compared. NIR results were validated against known skin concentrations measured by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of solvent extracts. NIR results matched the HPLC results for the quantification of 4-CP and EN in skin exposed to saturated solutions and topical creams with an   > 0.90, a standard error of estimation <7.0%, and a standard error of performance <8.0%. This experiment demonstrated that NIR closely parallels results obtained from tissue extraction and HPLC analysis, proving its potential utility for the rapid and noninvasive determination of topical bioavailability/bioequivalence of EN and quantification of the model chemical 4-CP.

Human native AGP was separated using imminodiacetate–copper (II) affinity chromatography into two fractions, the A variant and a mixture of the F1 and S variants (F1–S). These fractionated AGPs were further separated by concanavalin A affinity chromatography into two fractions, with and without biantenarry glycans. An on-line high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system consisting of a high-performance frontal analysis column, an extraction column, and an analytical HPLC column was developed to determine the binding affinities of OXY enantiomers for respective AGP species. The total binding affinity as well as the enantiomeric selectivity of OXY in the F1–S mixed variant was significantly higher than that for the A variant, indicating that the chiral recognition ability of native AGP for the OXY enantiomers highly depends on the F1–S mixed variant. Furthermore, not only the genetic variants but also bianntenary glycans of AGP affect the binding affinity of OXY and are also responsible for the enantioselectivity.

283,,,[],"The stability of protein unloaded and loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres fabricated with surfactant was challenged through exposure to environmental conditions of different relative humidity. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) or Triton X-100 was added to the primary emulsion of the double-emulsion solvent evaporation technique. After storage at ambient humidity and 75% relative humidity, the mechanical stability of the polymer was tested to reveal PLGA chain mobility using differential scanning calorimetry. Subsequent surface modifications were examined by atomic force microscopy (AFM), and protein release profiles were collected. Residual amounts of PVA and particularly Triton X-100 raised the hydrophilicity of the microspheres. When exposed to ambient humidity or 75% relative humidity, PVA and Triton X-100 had, respectively, an antiplasticizing and a plasticizing effect upon PLGA, and both led to physical aging. The high-resolution AFM imaging of microspheres containing model protein and Triton X-100 showed that the depth of the surface pores was reduced when exposed to 75% relative humidity, and the initial burst release subsequently decreased. These studies suggested that the mechanical stability of PLGA was influenced by the addition of surfactants, which, depending on the formulation, led to surface pore remodeling under high humidity, reducing the initial burst release while maintaining the spherical integrity of the microsphere.",,,,2006

These copolyesters were synthesized by ring opening polymerization (ROP), melt condensation (COND) and transesterification (TRANS) of high molecular weight poly(lactic acid) (PLA) with ricinoleic acid (PLA-RA), and repolymerization by condensation to yield random and block copolymers of weight average molecular weights (Mw) between 3000 and 13,000. All polymers showed an almost zero-order weight loss, with a 20–40% loss after 60 days of incubation.

The aim of this study was the evaluation of complement activation induced by nanoparticles coated with different polysaccharides. Influences of size and configuration of dextran, dextran sulfate, or chitosan bound onto nanoparticles were investigated. Core–shell nanoparticles were prepared by redox radical or anionic polymerization of isobutylcyanoacrylate in the presence of polysaccharides. Conversion of C3 into C3b in serum incubated with nanoparticles was evaluated. Cleavage of C3 increased with size of dextran bound in “loops” configuration, whereas it decreased when dextran was bound in “brush.” It was explained by an increasing steric repulsive effect of the brush, inducing poor accessibility to OH groups. The same trend was observed for chitosan-coated nanoparticles. Nanoparticles coated with a brush of chitosan activated the complement system lesser than nanoparticles coated with a brush of dextran. This was explained by an improved repelling effect. Dextran-sulfate-coated nanoparticles induced a low cleavage of C3 whereas it strongly enhanced protein adsorption. Complement activation was highly sensitive to surface features of the nanoparticles.

We investigated the relationship between FGF expression and paclitaxel activity in tumors from bladder, breast, head and neck, ovarian, and prostate cancer patients. Tumors (  = 96) were maintained in three-dimensional histocultures, retaining tumor–stromal interaction. Bladder tumors were treated with paclitaxel for 2 h, and the other tumors for 24 h. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of paclitaxel were quantified and correlated with expression of aFGF, bFGF, P-glycoprotein (Pgp), p53, and bcl-2. Fifty-one percent (49/96) and 63% (61/96) of tumors showed aFGF and bFGF staining, respectively. aFGF expression was positively correlated with tumor stage (  < 0.01), and bFGF expression with tumor grade and Pgp expression (  < 0.05). Paclitaxel inhibited antiproliferation in 86% of tumors (83/96), with an average inhibition of 46 ± 19% (mean ± SD) in the responding tumors. Paclitaxel also induced apoptosis in 96% of tumors (92/96), with an average apoptotic index of 12 ± 7% in the responding tumors. aFGF expression did not correlate with tumor sensitivity to paclitaxel, whereas bFGF expression showed an inverse correlation (  < 0.01). bFGF expression was a stronger predictor of paclitaxel resistance compared to Pgp, p53, or Bcl-2.

Solid-state metoclopramide samples were irradiated at several doses with gamma rays and high-energy electrons to evaluate the influence of the dose rate. High-performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector was used to measure the chemical potency as a function of the absorbed dose and to quantify the degradation products. The characterization of degradation products was performed by liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization/tandem mass spectrometry. The degradation of solid-state metoclopramide after irradiation was negligible. No qualitative or quantitative differences were observed between gamma and electron beam irradiations (no dose rate effect). Four degradation products that were similar to metoclopramide were detected in trace levels (below 0.1% of the drug concentration) and were not unique to irradiation because they were found in lower amounts in unirradiated metoclopramide. The major degradation product formed after radiation was due to the loss of the chlorine atom from the metoclopramide molecule.

After administration of 250 mL of water or 500 mL of Ensure plus® [both containing 10 mg/mL polyethylene glycol (PEG) 4000 as nonabsorbable marker], intestinal aspirates were collected from the fourth part of the duodenum of 12 healthy adults and from the mid-jejunum of four Labradors. Pooled samples were analyzed for PEG, pH, buffer capacity, osmolality, surface tension, pepsin, total carbohydrates, total protein content, bile salts, phospholipids, and neutral lipids.

For both compounds, solubility in canine contents may be predictive of human intralumenal solubility in the fasting state but not in the fed state. The poor agreement of results in canine and human aspirates can be attributed to the higher bile salt content in canine bile. Solubility in FaSSIF containing a mixture of bile salts from crude bile predicted satisfactorily the intralumenal solubility of both drugs in the fasted state in humans. Solubility in FeSSIF, regardless of the identity of bile salts or of the buffering species, deviated from intralumenal values in the fed human aspirates by up to 40%. This was attributed to the lack of lipolytic products in FeSSIF, the higher bile salt content of FeSSIF, and the lower pH of FeSSIF. FaSSIF containing a mixture of bile salts from crude bile, and FeSSIF containing lipolytic products and, perhaps, having lower bile salt content but slightly higher pH, should be more useful than canine intestinal aspirates for predicting intralumenal solubilities in humans.",,"This study was partly funded by the European Social Fund (ESF), (Greek) National Resources, and AstraZeneca AB (Sweden).",,2006

M6P/IGF-IIR mRNA expression was investigated 3, 7 and 10 days after BDL. At all time-points hepatic M6P/IGF-IIR expression was significantly increased compared to healthy controls. Moreover, immunohistochemical staining revealed that α-sma-positive cells were M6P/IGF-IIR-positive. In kidneys of TGR(mRen2)27 rats, the number of M6P/IGF-IIR-positive arteries per microscopic field was increased 5.5 fold over healthy controls. To examine whether M6P/IGF-IIRs could be used as a port of entry for drugs, we coupled mycophenolic acid (MPA) to mannose-6-phosphate-modified human serum albumin (M6PHSA). M6PHSA-MPA inhibited 3T3-fibroblast proliferation dose-dependently, which was reversed by co-incubation with excess M6PHSA, but not by HSA. M6P/IGF-IIRs are expressed by fibrogenic cells and may be used for receptor-mediated intracellular delivery of the antifibrogenic drug MPA.",bromodeoxy uridine hepatic stellate cell mycophenolic acid mannose-6-phosphate-modified human serum albumin mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor-II receptor phosphate buffered saline TGR(mRen2)27 transgenic rats α-smooth muscle actin,"This study was financially supported by the Dutch Foundation for Technical Sciences (STW), grant no GFA.5460.

Porous PLGA microspheres having primary amine groups on the surface were prepared using an oil-in-water (O/W) single emulsion method using Pluronic F-127 as an extractable porogen. Heparin was surface immobilized via covalent conjugation. bFGF was loaded into the heparin functionalized (PLGA-heparin) microspheres by a simple dipping method. The bFGF loaded PLGA-heparin microspheres were tested for   release and   angiogenic activity. PLGA microspheres with an open-porous structure were formed. The amount of conjugated amine group onto the microspheres was 1.93 ± 0.01 nmol/mg-microspheres, while the amount of heparin was 95.8 pmol/mg-microspheres. PLGA-heparin microspheres released out bFGF in a more sustained manner with a smaller extent of initial burst than PLGA microspheres, indicating that surface immobilized heparin controlled the release rate of bFGF. Subcutaneous implantation of bFGF loaded PLGA-heparin microspheres in mice significantly induced the formation of new vascular microvessels. PLGA microspheres with an open porous structure allowed significant amount of heparin immobilization and bFGF loading. bFGF loaded PLGA-HP microspheres showed sustained release profiles of bFGF  , demonstrating reversible and specific binding of bFGF to immobilized heparin.

ACV and VCV electrotransport experiments were conducted using excised porcine skin  . While the charged nature of the prodrug, VCV, enabled it to be more efficiently iontophoresed into the skin than the parent molecule, ACV, only the latter was detectable in the receptor chamber, suggesting that VCV was enzymatically cleaved into the active metabolite during skin transit. Iontophoresis of VCV was significantly more efficient than that of ACV; the cumulative permeation of ACV after 1, 2 and 3 h of VCV iontophoresis at 0.5 mA cm  and using an aqueous 2 mM (∼0.06%) formulation was 20 ± 10, 104 ± 47 and 194 ± 82 μg cm , respectively (cf. non-quantifiable levels, 0.1 and 1.0 ± 0.7 μg cm  after ACV iontophoresis).

                             experiments on isolated pig ears were compared with   studies in human volunteers. Four formulations, comprising the model drug, ibuprofen, in different propylene glycol (PG)-water mixtures (25:75, 50:50, 75:25 and 100:0), were compared. Derived dermatopharmacokinetic parameters characterizing the diffusion and partitioning of the drug in the SC   were consistent with those   following a 30-minute application period. Further, the non-steady-state   results could be used to predict the   concentration profile of the drug across the SC when a formulation was administered for 3 h (i.e., close to steady-state).

302,,,[],"Transscleral iontophoresis has been recently re-examined for drug delivery to the back of the eye. In conventional iontophoresis, due to the relatively high electromobility of the endogenous competing ions (counterions) relative to that of the drug ion in the tissue barrier, the efficiency of iontophoretic drug delivery is generally low. The objective of the present study was to examine ion-exchange membrane-enhanced transscleral iontophoretic transport in which the ion-exchange membrane in series with the sclera can hinder the transport of the competing counterions and selectively allow the transport of the permeant across the sclera. The physical properties of the Ionac ion-exchange membrane and excised rabbit sclera were determined in equilibrium uptake experiments and in passive and iontophoretic transport experiments with salicylate, tetraethylammonium, urea, and mannitol. Transscleral experiments with the ion-exchange membrane were conducted with salicylate and excised rabbit sclera  . The contribution of electroosmosis to electrotransport during transscleral iontophoresis was assessed with urea and mannitol. The ion-exchange membrane is highly positively charged and has a small effective pore size. The sclera is relatively porous with a large effective pore size and low pore tortuosity. The sclera is also net negatively charged but this does not significantly affect the transport of small ions. A three-fold steady-state transscleral flux enhancement of salicylate was observed in ion-exchange membrane-enhanced iontophoresis over conventional transscleral iontophoresis without the membrane. Such enhancement was relatively independent of the applied electric current density and the thickness of the studied ion-exchange membrane assembly. Although the ion-exchange membrane altered transscleral electroosmosis, the contribution of electroosmosis to electrotransport was not significant. The present study has demonstrated the potential of ion-exchange membranes for enhancing iontophoretic transport and drug delivery.",,"This research was supported in part by NIH Grant EY015181.

Verapamil HCl (VRP) was chosen as a model drug and dextran sulfate sodium (DS) as a counter-ionic polymer. Solubility parameters of VRP, VRP-DS complex, and various lipids were calculated and partition of VRP and VRP-DS in lipids was determined. Thermodynamics of VRP binding to DS was determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The solid state properties of individual components and their interactions were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). Dodecanoic acid (DA) was identified as the best lipid carrier among all lipids tested based on the solubility parameters and partition coefficients. VRP-DS complexation was a thermodynamically favorable process. Maximum binding capacity of DS and the highest drug loading capacity of DA were obtained at an equal ionic molar ratio of DS to VRP. In the PLN formulation, DA remained its crystal structure but had a slightly lower melting point, while VRP-DS complex was in an amorphous form.

305,,,[],"The bioavailability of a development candidate active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) was very low after oral dosing in dogs. In order to improve bioavailability, we sought to increase the dissolution rate of the solid form of the API. When traditional methods of forming salts and amorphous material failed to produce a viable solid form for continued development, we turned to the non-traditional approach of cocrystallization. A crystal engineering approach was used to design and execute a cocrystal screen of the API. Hydrogen bonding between the API and pharmaceutically acceptable carboxylic acids was identified as a viable synthon for associating multiple components in the solid state. A number of carboxylic acid guest molecules were tested for cocrystal formation with the API. A cocrystal containing the API and glutaric acid in a 1:1 molecular ratio was identified and the single crystal structure is reported. Physical characterization of the cocrystal showed that it is unique regarding thermal, spectroscopic, X-ray, and dissolution properties. The cocrystal solid is nonhygroscopic, and chemically and physically stable to thermal stress. Use of the cocrystal increased the aqueous dissolution rate by 18 times as compared to the homomeric crystalline form of the drug. Single dose dog exposure studies confirmed that the cocrystal increased plasma AUC values by three times at two different dose levels. APIs that are non-ionizable or demonstrate poor salt forming ability traditionally present few opportunities for creating crystalline solid forms with desired physical properties. Cocrystals are an additional class of crystalline solid that can provide options for improved properties. In this case, a crystalline molecular complex of glutaric acid and an API was identified and used to demonstrate an improvement in the oral bioavailability of the API in dogs.",,The authors thank Dr. Ken Hardcastle at the Emory University Chemistry Department X-Ray Diffraction Center for collecting and solving the single crystal structure of the cocrystal.

306,,,[],"Pharmaceutical tablets are generally produced by compacting a mixture of several ingredients, including active drugs and excipients. It is of practical importance if the properties of such tablets can be predicted on the basis of the ones for constituent components. The purpose of this work is to develop a theoretical model which can predict the tensile strength of compacted multi-component pharmaceutical mixtures. The model was derived on the basis of the Ryshkewitch‐Duckworth equation that was originally proposed for porous materials. The required input parameters for the model are the relative density or solid fraction (ratio of the volume of solid materials to the total volume of the tablets) of the multi-component tablets and parameters associated with the constituent single-component powders, which are readily accessible. The tensile strength of tablets made of various powder blends at different relative density was also measured using diametrical compression. It has been shown that the tensile strength of the multi-component powder compacts is primarily a function of the solid fraction. Excellent agreement between prediction and experimental data for tablets of binary, ternary and four-component blends of some widely used pharmaceutical excipients was obtained. It has been demonstrated that the proposed model can well predict the tensile strength of multi-component pharmaceutical tablets.

309,,,[],"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effect of surfactant-plasticizers on the physical stability of amorphous drug in polymer matrices formed by hot melt extrusion. Solid dispersions of a poorly soluble drug were prepared using PVP-K30, Plasdone-S630, and HPMC-E5 as the polymeric carriers and surfactants as plasticizers. The solid dispersions were produced by hot melt extrusion at temperatures 10°C above and below the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the carrier polymers using a 16 mm-Haake Extruder. The surfactants tested in this study included Tween-80 and Docusate Sodium. The particle size of the extrudate was reduced to have mean of 100–200 micron. The physical stability of the solid dispersions produced was monitored at 30°C/60% for six-months and at 60°C/85% for two-months in open HDPE bottles. Modulated differential scanning calorimetry, polarized light microscopy, powder X-ray diffraction and dissolution testing was performed to assess the physical stability of solid dispersions upon stress testing. The dispersions containing HPMC-E5 were observed especially to be susceptible to physical instability under an accelerated stress conditions (60°C/85%RH) of the solid dispersion. About 6% conversion of amorphous drug to crystalline form was observed. Consequently, the system exhibits similar degree of re-crystallization upon addition of the surfactant. However, under 30°C/60%RH condition, the otherwise amorphous Drug-HPMC-E5 system has been destabilized by the addition of the surfactant. This effect is much more reduced in the extruded solid dispersions where polymeric carriers such as Plasdone S-603 and PVP-K30 (in addition to surfactants) are present. Furthermore, the drug release from the solid dispersions was unaffected at the stress conditions reported above. Possible reasons for the enhanced stability of the dispersions are due to the surfactants ability to lower the viscosity of the melt, increase the API solubility and homogeneity in the carrier polymer. In contrast, while it is possible for the surfactants to destabilize the system by lowering the Tg and increasing the water uptake, the study confirms that this effect is minimal. By and large, the surfactants appear to be promising plasticizers to produce solid dispersions by hot melt extrusion, in so doing improving dissolution rate without compromising the physical stability of the systems.",,A.N.

Thereby, the time devoted to the storage tests could be reduced and manufacturers could save time in optimizing their formulations and manufacturing techniques for topical pharmaceutical forms. The influence of the type of oil and the type of emulsifier on the microstructure of the emulsions was also studied. The samples were stored at 25 and at 50°C for 6 months and analysed every month using rheological as well as microscopic techniques. The size and the organization of the droplets within the emulsion were determined by freeze-fracture electron microscopy and optical contrast phase microscopy. A decrease in the rheological parameters was observed for the OC emulsions (“Tween/Span” emulsions made with olive oil) and the “Montanov” emulsions. The rheological measurements showed that the structure of the OC emulsions and that of the emulsions made with the Montanov 82 emulsifier become more brittle when submitted to a shear force. The micrographs obtained by freeze-fracture electron microscopy showed that for OC only the oil droplets arrange in a network structure. Storage tests at 50°C confirmed the rheological assumptions on the stability of emulsions. The study of the effect of shearing on the emulsions allowed quick discrimination between the emulsions according to their stabilities.

(ii) Characterize the physical form of drug in intact pharmaceutical film-coated tablets by XRD. An equation for the calculation of the penetration depth of X-rays, as a function of the incident angle, was derived. Model bilayer tablets were prepared to validate the calculation method. The upper layer of the tablets consisted only of microcrystalline cellulose, while the lower layer was a mixture of cerium oxide (10% w/w), blue dye (5% w/w) and microcrystalline cellulose. The total tablet thickness was 3,500 μm, with the upper layer thickness ranging from 200 to 700 μm. The diffracted intensity of a cerium oxide peak in the lower layer was determined using a microdiffractometer system (CuKα radiation) with a two-dimensional area detector. The calculated penetration depth of X-rays was compared with that determined by XRD. After validation of the XRD method, commercial ibuprofen tablets were characterized. The penetration depth calculated by the method developed in this study was, in general, in good agreement with that determined experimentally by XRD. In commercial ibuprofen tablets, the coating material exhibited peaks due to TiO  (25.4°2 ) and Fe O  (33.3°). However, these did not interfere with the characteristic peak of ibuprofen (22.2°). We developed a method for calculation of penetration depth of X-rays in film-coated tablets and validated it using the model bilayer tablets. This method enables the characterization of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in different regions (at different depths) of the film-coated tablet.

In a first step nanoparticles were generated by ionotropic gelation of polyacrylic acid (PAA) of three different molecular weights (100, 240 and 450 kDa) and various cations including Ca , Mg , Zn , Al  and Fe . Via   characterization of the particles (particle size, size distribution and zeta potential) the optimal preparation conditions were established. Taking into consideration, that thiolated polyacrylic acid (PAA-Cys) displays higher mucoadhesive and permeation enhancing properties than unmodified PAA, PAA-Cys nanoparticles were produced in the same manner with Ca , as the most promising results concerning particle size and stability of particles could be achieved with this ionic crosslinker. The nanoparticles were stabilized via the formation of inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds within these particles due to oxidation with H O . Ca  was removed proximately by the addition of EDTA and exhaustive dialysis. Using the preparation method described above PAA-Cys nanoparticles of a mean diameter of about 220 nm (PAA -Cys), 250 nm (PAA -Cys) and 295 nm (PAA -Cys) can be generated. In comparison to PAA nanoparticles ionically crosslinked with Ca , the removal of the crosslinker Ca  from PAA-Cys particles led to a nearly three-fold decrease in the zeta potential, from about −7 up to −20 mV. Apart from this advantage, covalently crosslinked PAA-Cys nanoparticles were more firm as they remained stable when incubated in hydrochloride solution, whereas ionically crosslinked particles dissolved at pH lower than 5.

The FPF particles (< 5 μm) of these formulations were measured by laser diffraction and inertial impaction at flow rates between 28.3 and 100 l min . When only the particles with diameter < 60 μm obtained by laser diffraction were considered the FPF (< 5 μm) could be determined and this enabled the aerosolisation of all 16 blends to be feasibly compared at flow rates ranging from 28.3 to 100 l min . A significant linear correlation was found between the fine fractions measured by laser diffraction and the salbutamol fine fractions determined by inertial impaction ( 
                             = 0.934). Such correlation was also confirmed for formulations containing added fine lactose.

Particle size distribution of terbutaline sulphate from Bricanyl™ Turbohaler™, which contained loose agglomerates of drug particles only, was measured separately by laser diffraction apparatus equipped with a metal throat and a twin-stage, multi-stage liquid impingers, or Andersen cascade impactor at flow rates ranging from 28.3 to 100 l min . In-line measurements were then conducted which allowed the same aerosolised particles to be measured first by laser diffraction then captured by an impactor or impinger for subsequent chemical analysis. A significant linear correlation (  < 0.001,  
                             = 0.96, ANOVA) existed between the results obtained from two techniques when measurements were conducted independently. There was little difference in FPFs measured by inertial impaction and laser diffraction at the same flow rate. When in-line measurements were conducted, the FPFs measured by inertial impaction were approximately 0.7–0.9 times the aerosol FPFs measured by laser diffraction. This linear relationship was statistically significant and had a statistically insignificant  -intercept, regardless of inhaler batches, impinger types and measuring position of the laser beam. Laser diffraction could prove to be a reliable technique for development, evaluation and quality control of carrier-free, dry powder aerosol formulations.",,,,2006

The influence of drug loading, homogenization pressure and cycles on particle size reduction was investigated by experimental design using a Box Behnken matrix with insulin as a model compound. Particle size measurements were performed by laser light scattering. Protein stability was investigated by HPLC and HPLC-MS analysis and the bioactivity of insulin was tested in a chondrocyte proliferation assay. For investigations into the effect of temperature on protein stability, insulin was micronized in molten lipid at 75°C in one cycle at 1,000 bar. Within one homogenization cycle at 1,500 bar, the particle size of insulin could be reduced from 15.8 to 7.3 μm, six cycles resulted in a particle size of 3.7 μm  (0.5) (50% of the particles are smaller than the indicated value). Evaluation of the response surface diagram revealed that the homogenization pressure had the highest impact on micronization efficiency, followed by the number of homogenization cycles. Protein stability was maintained during the micronization process as well as bioactivity. Micronization at elevated temperature (75°C) had no effect on protein stability.

The vesicles appeared flattened with diameters from 100 to 300 nm and heights that varied from 10 to 100 nm. Phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol vesicles were mixed with bile salt solutions to yield supersaturated (with respect to cholesterol) dispersions, which were then placed onto mica, silanized mica, and mucin-covered mica substrates. After equilibration, sub-micron sized, plate-like structures were observed at the mica and mucin covered surface, but none were seen at the silanized surface. The morphology was characterized as it pertains to the relative growth rates of the crystal faces.

324,,,[],"The purpose of this research was to develop a quantitative mass transport model to describe the release of a drug from a porous inert matrix dosage form near and below the percolation threshold for the system. Cumulative release profiles were generated for a series of tablets composed of a binary mixture of varying amounts of non-conducting (poly(vinyl stearate)) and conducting (benzoic acid) components. The porous microstructure was analyzed using re-constructed three-dimensional images of leached microtomed tablet sections. Poly(vinyl stearate) was characterized for transport properties, molecular weight and thermal properties. Based on percolation theory, the binary matrix was determined to have a percolation threshold of 0.09 ± 0.02. Transport, which could not be explained by “classical” percolation theory or surface diffusion alone, was observed below the percolation threshold for the system. A model describing transport near and below the percolation threshold in matrices composed of two phases, polymer and drug, was developed. The percolation model developed accounts for diffusion within the porous structure and through the inert, insoluble polymeric amorphous regions of the matrix. The low percolation threshold and subsequently high coordination was concluded to be due to the biphasic classical porous and nonclassical polymeric diffusional transport mechanisms associated with the system studied.",,"This research was funded in part by the American Chemical Society Chapter of the Petroleum Research Foundation, Glaxo Inc., and the Burroughs Wellcome Fund.

325,,,[],"To demonstrate control of passive diffusion of small molecules through rigid ceramic matrices via manipulation of matrix porosity near the percolation threshold, and to model such control using percolation scaling relationships on both infinite and finite lattices. Rigid alumina disks of controlled porosity were prepared using standard ceramic casting and sintering techniques. Structural void space distributions in sintered disks were measured by dimensional and volume displacement (pycnometry) methods. The impact of void space on transport was determined by tracking the diffusion of ionized benzoic acid across sintered disks mounted in Stokes diffusion cells. Critical percolation thresholds were estimated by fitting structural and transport-dependent results to percolation scaling relationships. Finite-size scaling studies were performed by adding polymer microspheres of known diameter to the disks to generate artificially large pores. Nonlinear least squares techniques were used to fit both structural and transport-dependent properties of rigid alumina disks to total disk porosity using percolation scaling relationships. The critical percolation threshold determined from structural properties (0.129) was lower than that determined from benzoic acid transport (0.169). The transport-derived percolation threshold exactly matched that expected for a tetrakaidecahedral (14 sided) lattice. Finite-size scaling was demonstrated through a nonzero effective volume fraction for transport at the percolation threshold. Manipulation of total disk porosity near the percolation threshold was shown to be a suitable means of controlling the transport rate of a model small molecule, while deliberate enlargement of individual pores was demonstrated to decrease this threshold without increasing total porosity. The lower-than-expected percolation threshold obtained from the structural model was ascribed to limitations of the measurement technique. The threshold determined from the aqueous transport model was concluded to represent the true threshold for this system.",,"This work was funded in part through a 2-year Advanced Predoctoral Fellowship awarded by the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's Association Foundation, Washington, DC.",,2006
326,,,[],"Evaluation of the effect of formulation composition and processing variables on the microenvironment in solid dosage forms, based on ionization of indicator probes. Sulfonephthalein indicators were intimately mixed with individual excipients, binary excipient mixtures or multi-component blends by the solvent deposition method. Diffuse reflectance visible spectroscopy of these solids provided a measure of indicator ionization extent. Indicator solution studies yielded equations relating solution pH to the ratio of the absorbance signals of the ionized to that of the unionized form, for each indicator. These equations and the spectral data of the indicator-treated solids were used to calculate an acidity function, ‘pH ’ for the solids. The ionization of incorporated probes was also monitored during various stages of simulated pharmaceutical processing  . wet and dry mixing. The pH  provided a measure of the physicochemical environment experienced by the probe in the solid. The surface nature of formulation components and their surface area available for interaction influenced the overall properties of the final blend. The extent of probe ionization varied at different stages of a simulated wet mixing–drying process. The pH of the excipient suspension was not a good predictor of the probe ionization in the final dried solid. Indicator ionization is expected to be influenced by the microenvironmental acidity, polarity and ionic strength. Individual excipient properties contributed to the overall microenvironment in powder mixtures even when dry mixed at low water contents. The environment experienced by a drug in the final solid dosage form will be influenced by the nature of the excipients, the extent of their surfaces available for interaction, surface modification during processing and the amount and nature of solvent used.",,The authors wish to thank Pfizer Global R&D for financial support and the anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments which helped to improve the manuscript.

327,,,[],"The ability to predict the passive intestinal absorption of organic compounds can be a valuable tool in drug design. Although Lipinski's ‘rule of 5’ is commonly used for this purpose, it does not routinely give reliable results. An alternative ‘rule of unity’ is proposed to predict the absorption efficiency of orally administered drugs that are passively transported. The rule of unity based upon the theoretical principals that govern passive transport. The ‘rule of 5’ and the ‘rule of unity’ are compared using experimentally determined passive human intestinal absorption data for 155 drugs. Absorption values which are >50% of the dose are classified as well absorbed and absorption values which are ≤50% of the dose are classified as classified as poorly absorbed. Comparison of the two models using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) plot and McNemar's test reveal striking differences in absorption predictability. The ‘rule of 5’ gives twice as many false predictions than the ‘rule of unity.’",,,,2006
328,,,[],"The purpose of these studies was to determine the extent to which drug loading influences the mass transport characteristics of poorly soluble steroids from model microemulsion formulations  . Two conditions of drug loading in the microemulsions were tested, “near saturation” and “constant loaded.” Mass flux of  H-labelled progesterone or estradiol was measured in a side-by-side diffusion chamber from microemulsions consisting of Brij 97, Miglyol 812 and water. Pulsed gradient NMR was used to measure the diffusivities of all components. The thermodynamic activity and fraction of free drug in the formulations were measured by polymer uptake. Solute flux was calculated employing an aqueous boundary layer model. Under near saturation loading, all microemulsion formulations showed significantly increased flux of steroids compared to the saturated aqueous solution. For both steroids flux values in the 0.5 and 1% systems were significantly lower for the 3% oil formulation, despite the observation that the 3% formulation held significantly more drug. On the other hand, for all the formulations under constant drug loading, solute flux was only moderately increased for progesterone and not at all for estradiol when compared to the saturated aqueous solution. Under both loading conditions, thermodynamic activities did not correlate to flux indicating some other factor was modulating mass transport. Effective diffusivities of the steroids in formulations as determined by NMR were significantly reduced compared to those of the monomer drug in aqueous solution. In both near-saturated and constant-loaded conditions, the calculated values for progesterone flux were markedly similar to those observed experimentally suggesting solubilization and diffusion events in the aqueous boundary layer had a strong influence on mass transport. In contrast, calculations for estradiol were less successful in modeling the observed flux values. In systems nearly saturated with drug, the microemulsion formulation leads to a greatly enhanced rate of steady-state mass transport while in systems with drug loading far from saturation, the microemulsion formulation appears to have a minimal ability to promote mass transport. The aqueous boundary layer diffusion model was successful in fitting progesterone results but was not successful for estradiol.",,"The authors would like to thank Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Inc for providing the funding to carry out this work.

Although it is known that the antivirals are substrates of the human renal organic anion transporter hOAT1 (SLC22A6), there is no information available on other organic ion transporters. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the other renal organic anion transporter hOAT3 (SLC22A8) and organic cation transporter hOCT2 (SLC22A2) transport the antivirals. Uptake experiments were performed using HEK293 cells transfected with cDNA of the organic ion transporters. The uptake of adefovir, cidofovir and tenofovir in monolayers stably expressing hOAT3 increased time-dependently, compared with control. Probenecid, a typical inhibitor of organic anion transporters, completely inhibited their transport. The amounts of the antivirals taken up by hOAT3 were much lower than those by hOAT1. The transient expression of hOCT2 did not increase uptake of the antivirals. These results indicate that adefovir, cidofovir and tenofovir are substrates of hOAT3 as well as hOAT1, but that quantitatively hOAT1 is the major renal transporter for these drugs.",human organic anion transporter human organic cation transporter multidrug resistance protein.,"This work was supported in part by a grant-in-aid for Research on Advanced Medical Technology from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan, by a Japan Health Science Foundation “Research on Health Sciences Focusing on Drug Innovation,” by a grant-in-aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Science, Culture and Sports of Japan, and by the 21st Century COE program “Knowledge Information Infrastructure for Genome Science.”",,2007

337,,,[],"Knowledge about the uptake mechanism and subsequent intracellular routing of non-viral gene delivery systems is important for the development of more efficient carriers. In this study we compared two established cationic polymers pDMAEMA and PEI with regard to their transfection efficiency and mechanism of cellular uptake. The effects of several inhibitors of particular cellular uptake routes on the uptake of polyplexes and subsequent gene expression in COS-7 cells were investigated using FACS and transfection. Moreover, cellular localization of fluorescently labeled polyplexes was assessed by spectral fluorescence microscopy. Both pDMAEMA- and PEI-complexed DNA showed colocalization with fluorescently-labeled transferrin and cholera toxin after internalization by COS-7 cells, which indicates uptake via the clathrin- and caveolae-dependent pathways. Blocking either routes of uptake with specific inhibitors only resulted in a marginal decrease in polyplex uptake, which may suggest that uptake routes of polyplexes are interchangeable. Despite the marginal effect of inhibitors on polyplex internalization, blocking the caveolae-mediated uptake route resulted in an almost complete loss of polyplex-mediated gene expression, whereas gene expression was not negatively affected by blocking the clathrin-dependent route of uptake. These results show the importance of caveolae-mediated uptake for successful gene expression and have implications for the rational design of non-viral gene delivery systems.",,,,2007

For many pulse-chase regimes, K562 cell viability was least affected by doxorubicin. In K562 cells, nuclear drug accumulation was greatest, but nuclear drug egress was also greatest. P-glycoprotein over-expression in a doxorubicin-resistant, K562/DOX sub-line did not facilitate doxorubicin efflux from  the nucleus. In K562 cells, doxorubicin accumulated in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) through a pH-dependent mechanism. Inhibiting drug sequestration in MVBs did not affect nuclear efflux. The rates of doxorubicin efflux from the nuclei of live and digitonin-permeabilized K562 cells were similar. However, extracting cytoplasmic membranes with Triton X-100 significantly inhibited nuclear drug efflux following extracellular drug clearance. Our results are consistent with drug efflux from the nucleus being primarily mediated by an ATP-independent, passive diffusion mechanism. The effect of membrane extraction suggests that nonspecific drug absorption to cytoplasmic membranes plays a role in facilitating nuclear efflux in K562 cells, perhaps by lowering the concentration of free doxorubicin from a perinuclear diffusion boundary layer.",,We thank Dr. Duxin Sun and Seth Gibbs and for the K562/DOX cells.

The heparin-coated PLGA may enhance blood and tissue compatibility of PLGA devices and provide a novel approach to deliver growth factors. A one-step method using heparin to replace traditional emulsifiers (e.g., PVA) during emulsion-solvent evaporation process was employed to surface-entrap heparin in PLGA microspheres. The emulsifying activity of heparin was modified   varying counter ion form, including univalent (Na , K , Li , and  ) and divalent (Ca , Mg , Ba , and Zn ) cations, and complexation with amino acids (Arg, Lys, Leu, Val, Gly and Glu). Surface accessible and total heparin loading were determined by a modified toluidine blue assay and elemental analysis, respectively. Heparin bound with univalent counter ions and amino acids exhibited emulsifying activity to varying degrees, whereas divalent heparin salts tended to cause complete aggregation of the PLGA o/w emulsion. Increasing pH (≥7.4) of hardening medium enhanced heparin adsorption and significantly stabilized the PLGA o/w emulsion. The initial surface density of heparin on the PLGA microspheres prepared using univalent heparin salts was around 8–33 mg/m .

The PILs formulation was able to significantly increase the HER2 mediated cellular uptake of paclitaxel compared to the PLs in cell lines overexpressing HER2 (BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells). However, in the MDA-MB-231 cells, which express low levels of HER2, the difference between the PILs and PLs formulation was not significant. The biological activity of Herceptin was maintained throughout the conjugation process as exhibited by the antitumor dose–response curves determined for Herceptin itself, for the thiolated Herceptin alone and subsequently for the immunoliposome-coupled Herceptin. In BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells, the cytotoxicity of the PILs was more potent than that of Taxol.

Changes in the microstructure were established using conductivity (σ), viscosity (η), surface tension (γ) and density measurements. Dissolution studies and particle size analysis were carried out to understand the release of isoniazid from the microemulsion formulation. Further, partitioning studies and spectroscopic analysis (FT-IR and  H NMR) was performed to evaluate the location of drug in the colloidal formulation. Physico-chemical analysis of microemulsion system showed the occurrence of structural changes from water-in-oil to oil-in-water microemulsion. It has been observed that the microemulsion remained stable after the incorporation of isoniazid (in terms of optical texture, pH and phase separation). The changes in the microstructure of the microemulsion after incorporation of drug was analyzed on the basis of partition studies of isoniazid in microemulsion components and various parameters viz pH, σ, η,γ. In addition, the particle size analysis indicates that the microemulsion changes into o/w emulsion at infinite dilution. The spectroscopic studies revealed that most of the drug molecules are present in the continuum region of an o/w microemulsion. Dissolution studies infer that a controlled release of drug is expected from o/w emulsion droplet. In the present system the release of isoniazid from microemulsion was found to be non-Fickian.

The topic has been discussed on numerous occasions at national and international meetings. Despite the lack of a universally accepted solution for the issue, regulatory agencies generally agree that an adjustment of the traditional BE limits for these drugs or products may be warranted to alleviate the resource burden of studying relatively large numbers of subjects in bioequivalence trials. This report summarizes a careful examination of all the statistical methods available and extensive simulations for BE assessment of highly variable drugs/products. Herein, the authors present an approach of scaling an average BE criterion to the within-subject variability of the reference product in a crossover BE study, together with a point-estimate constraint imposed on the geometric mean ratio between the test and reference products. The use of a reference-scaling approach involves the determination of variability of the reference product, which requires replication of the reference treatment in each individual.

The effects of these hormones on BCRP protein and mRNA expression in BeWo cells were determined by immunoblotting and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, respectively. The effects of these hormones on membrane localization of BCRP in BeWo cells were examined by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy. E , hPL, and hPRL significantly increased BCRP protein and mRNA approximately two to threefold at physiological concentrations. Induction of BCRP by E  was abrogated by the estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist ICI-182,780. However, knock-down of ERα by RNA interference did not abolish the inductive effect of E . Testosterone by itself did not affect BCRP expression at physiological concentrations. However, testosterone together with 17β-estradiol (E ) increased BCRP protein and mRNA approximately twofold, and this induction was abolished by ICI-182,780 or the testosterone receptor (TR) antagonist flutamide or knock-down of ERα expression. Further analysis revealed that E  increased TR mRNA approximately 5.9-fold, suggesting that testosterone in combination with E  increases BCRP expression, possibly through E -mediated up-regulation of TR. hCG at physiological concentrations had no effect on BCRP expression.

Methotrexate clearance was then examined   in wildtype and Oat3 knockout mice.

Male wildtype mice, but not knockouts or females, demonstrated significantly accelerated methotrexate clearance in response to reduced folates. Reduced folates also markedly inhibited hepatic methotrexate accumulation in males, but not females, and the response was independent of Oat3 function. Oat3 contributes to methotrexate clearance, but represents only one component responsible for methotrexate’s elimination. Therefore, in patients, dysfunctional hOAT3 polymorphisms or drug competition for hOAT3 transport may severely impact methotrexate elimination only when redundant means of methotrexate removal are also compromised. Furthermore, the present findings suggest that reduced-folate administration only influences methotrexate disposition in males, with the renal reduced-folate response influenced by OAT3 function.","5-methyltetrahydrofolate 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (a.k.a. folinic acid or leucovorin) 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with empty vector Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with murine organic anion transporter 3 dihydroxyphenylacetic acid human the Michaelis–Menten constant mouse multidrug resistance-associated protein methotrexate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs human or non-human organic anion transporter, respectively rat reduced folate carrier 1","This work was supported by National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Grant R01-DK-067216 (D.H.S.), by fellowship provisions from the American Foundation for Pharmaceutical Education (A.L.V.), and by the National Institutes of Health Grant Number C06 RR015455 from the Extramural Research Facilities Program of the National Center for Research Resources.",,2008
354,,,[],"The human organic anion transporting polypeptide C (OATPC) is one of the major transport proteins involved in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts and plays an important role in vectorial transport of organic anions and drugs across hepatocytes. In this study, the effects of biological reagents on the membrane localization of OATPC were investigated by confocal microscopy and estrone-3-sulfate transport. Our results demonstrated that the functional membrane expression of fluorescent chimera OATPC-GFP was achieved in non-polarized (COS7 and HEK293) and polarized (MDCK) cells. Both brefeldin A (a Golgi complex disruptor) and bafilomycin A1 (an inhibitor of vacuolar H -ATPase) treatment significantly decreased the polarized membrane trafficking and markedly reduced the uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (∼40–90%) in OATPC-GFP transfected cells, suggesting that membrane sorting of hOATPC-GFP was mediated by Golgi complex and vacuolar H -ATPase-related vesicle transport pathways. Treatment with 8-Br-cAMP (a cAMP analog) stimulated OATPC-GFP membrane localization and enhanced estrone-3-sulfate uptake by ∼20%. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitors (H89 and KT5720), but not a PKG inhibitor, blocked the polarized membrane expression of OATPC-GFP and reduced estrone-3-sulfate transport activity. The simultaneous treatment of cells with PKA activator/inhibitor and bafilomycin A1 demonstrated that bafilomycin A1 did not change the effects of 8-Br-cAMP and H89 on the membrane localization of OATPC-GFP compared with the use of 8-Br-cAMP and H89 alone. These data suggest that a cAMP-PKA sensitive membrane sorting pathway for OATPC-GFP is independent of the vacuolar H -ATPase associated (bafilomycin A1 sensitive) vesicle mediated membrane sorting pathway. In contrast, with combined treatment with brefeldin A, neither the PKA-activator (8-Br-cAMP) nor the inhibitor (H89) further altered the plasma membrane expression and transport activity of OATPC-GFP compared with brefeldin A treatment alone. These data suggest that the cAMP-PKA regulation of OATPC membrane expression involves the Golgi complex. When the Golgi apparatus was disrupted by brefeldin A treatment, the effects of cAMP-PKA on the Golgi-to-basolateral surface sorting process of OATPC was also diminished. In summary, the plasma membrane localization of human OATPC is mediated by Golgi complex and vacuolar H -ATPase vesicle mediated membrane sorting pathways. cAMP-PKA regulates sorting process through the Golgi complex but not the vacuolar H -ATPase associated vesicular pathway.","bafilomycin A1 brefeldin A Estrone-3-sulfate green fluorescent protein

To investigate structural parameters that influence hydrogel formation and physical properties. Three ABA triblock and two AB diblock coiled-coil containing polypeptides were designed and biologically synthesized. The triblock polypeptides had two terminal coiled-coil (A) domains and a central random coil (B) segment. The coiled-coil domains were different in their lengths, and tyrosine residues were incorporated at selected solvent-exposed positions in order to increase the overall hydrophobicity of the coiled-coil domains. The secondary structures of these polypeptides were characterized by circular dichroism and analytical ultracentrifugation. The formation of hydrogel structures was evaluated by microrheology and scanning electron microscopy. Hydrogels self-assembled from the triblock polypeptides, and had interconnected network microstructures. Hydrogel formation was reversible. Denaturation of coiled-coil domains by guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) resulted in disassembly of the hydrogels. Removal of GdnHCl by dialysis caused coiled-coil refolding and hydrogel reassembly. Protein ABA triblock polypeptides composed of a central random block flanked by two coiled-coil forming sequences self-assembled into hydrogels.

A mixture of anhydrous theophylline and the excipient was granulated in a high-shear granulator, using water as the granulation liquid. Non-contact Raman spectroscopy was used to monitor the rate of transformation of anhydrate to hydrate during the granulation process. The kinetics of conversion was also monitored in slurries of theophylline whereby the excipients were added to the aqueous phase. Optical microscopy was used to visualize the transformation and to measure the linear growth rates of hydrate crystals in the presence and absence of the excipients. At pharmaceutically relevant amounts of excipient, the transformation kinetics of theophylline was unchanged for the majority of excipients tested. However, when granulating with low concentrations of some commonly used polymeric binders, the transformation kinetics could be significantly retarded. For example, methylcellulose polymers delayed both the onset of hydrate formation as well as retarding the transformation rate. When 0.3% ( / ) of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose was added to a model formulation containing 30% ( / ) theophylline anhydrous, the formation of the monohydrate could be completely prevented over the time period of the granulation experiment, without significantly affecting the granular properties. Microscopic observations of hydrate formation in the presence of the polymer revealed that the polymers that inhibited hydrate formation reduced the hydrate crystal growth rates and influenced hydrate morphology. Raman spectroscopy is a useful technique to monitor hydrate formation during wet granulation.

Enoxaparin, a LMWH, was complexed with PLAs of different molecular weights at varying concentrations. The resulting complexes were characterized by measuring particle size and zeta potential, and by quantitating the interactions between PLA and enoxaparin using an azure A assay. Changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and cytotoxicity induced by enoxaparin–PLA complex were investigated in Calu-3 cells. Pulmonary absorption of LMWH was determined by measuring plasma anti-factor Xa levels. A bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) study was performed to investigate if the PLA-based formulations caused any cellular or biochemical changes in the lungs. The particle size of enoxaparin–PLA complexes decreased and the zeta potential values of the complex became less negative as the concentration of positively charged PLA in the complex increased.   experiments suggest that addition of enoxaparin–PLA complex to the apical side of a polarized cell monolayer results in a significant increase in permeability to  C-mannitol and a decrease in TEER. Pulmonary formulations of enoxaparin plus 0.0125% or 0.0625% PLA of molecular weight 93 kDa led to a twofold increase in the relative bioavailability of LMWH compared to the control (enoxaparin plus normal saline).

Herein, the conformational variance in the crystals was examined by density functional theory (DFT) calculations in order to understand the mutual influence between electronic structures and crystal packing. Electronic structures of the two polymorphs and the single molecule of indomethacin were calculated with quantum mechanical methods. Electronic properties based upon conceptual density functional theory were thereby analyzed. A potential energy surface was generated with regard to the conformational flexibility, which was identified by the electronic analysis. Lattice energies of the two polymorphs were further calculated with an empirically augmented DFT method. Electronic properties, including electronic and nuclear Fukui functions, provided a fundamental understanding of the energetic competition in the indomethacin molecule between delocalization of  -orbitals of two aromatic rings and steric repulsions.

Calculated lattice energies suggest the α-form is more stable than the γ-form at the zero K. The polymorphism of indomethacin lies in various meta-stable conformations of the molecule that are results of different orientations between the two aromatic indole and phenyl rings.

Functionalized metallic islands are fabricated and utilized as individual templates for crystal formation. Taking advantage of the different wetting properties that patterned surfaces offered, arrays of small solution droplets on the nano- and pico- liter scale were produced on the substrates. Different droplet dimensions were deposited on the substrate. As the solvent evaporates from the droplets, crystals were formed within the constrained volume. Crystal habits were examined with optical microscopy while the solid form was identified with Raman microscopy. With mefenamic acid (MA) and sulfathiazole as model pharmaceutical compounds, two and four different polymorphs, respectively, were observed under identical conditions. Moreover, it is established that the polymorphic distribution is highly dependent on the solvent evaporation rate and the solution concentration. These results imply that multiple crystal forms competitively nucleate in solution, and the probability of each form nucleating is strongly dependent on the supersaturation of the solution. Additionally, solvent was observed to play a role in controlling the solid state outcome. Multiple crystal forms can concomitantly nucleate on patterned substrates.

Spin coated films of felodipine with poly(vinylpyrrolidone) (PVP), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) and hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC) were exposed to different storage relative humidities and nucleation rates were measured using polarized light microscopy. Solid dispersions were further characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, infrared spectroscopy and gravimetric measurement of water vapor sorption. It was found that the polymer additive reduced nucleation rates whereas absorbed water enhanced the nucleation rate as anticipated. When both polymer and water were present, nucleation rates were reduced relative to those of the pure amorphous drug stored at the same relative humidity, despite the fact that the polymer containing systems absorbed more water. Differences between the stabilizing abilities of the various polymers were observed and these were explained by the variations in the moisture contents of the solid dispersions caused by the different hygroscopicities of the component polymers. No correlations could be drawn between nucleation rates and the glass transition temperature ( 
                            ) of the system. PVP containing solid dispersions appeared to undergo molecular level changes on exposure to moisture which may be indicative of phase separation.

Here we present an approach to improve the mechanical properties of fibrin-based TEV and examine the relationship between mechanical strength and smooth muscle cell (SMC) function. To this end, we prepared TEV that were composed of two layers: a cellular layer containing SMC embedded in fibrin hydrogel to provide contractility and matrix remodeling; and a second cell-free fibrin layer composed of high concentration fibrinogen to provide mechanical strength. The ultimate tensile force of double-layered TEV increased with FBG concentration in the cell-free layer in a dose-dependent manner. Double-layered TEV exhibited burst pressure that was ten-fold higher than single-layered tissues but vascular reactivity remained high even though the cells were constricting an additional tissue layer. These results showed that mechanical strength results largely from the biomaterial but contractility requires active cellular machinery.

Furthermore, we demonstrated that the proangiogenic capacity of this material is related to the soluble dissolution products of Bioglass and the subsequent production of cell-secreted angiogenic factors by stimulated cells. These studies suggest that this bioactive glass possesses a robust proangiogenic potential, and this strategy may provide an alternative to recombinant inductive growth factors.",,"The authors acknowledge financial support from the American Cancer Society and the Dean, UC Davis School of Medicine [notice ACS IRG-95-125-07] and David Fyhrie for use of mechanical testing equipment.",,2008
378,,,[],"To attain the effective local and sustained delivery of plasmid DNA (pDNA) encoding for a growth factor. We hypothesized that controlling the degradation rate of biomaterials encapsulating pDNA via concurrent physical dissociation of the cross-linked structure and hydrolytic chain breakage of polymers would allow one to significantly broaden the range of pDNA release rate. This hypothesis was examined using ionically cross-linked polysaccharide hydrogels which were previously designed to rapidly degrade via engineering of ionic cross-linking junction and partial oxidation of polysaccharide chains. The hydrogel degradation rates were varied over the broad range, and pDNA release correlated with the gel degradation rate. Degradable hydrogels were used for the local and sustained delivery of a pDNA encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the ischemic hindlimbs of mice, and local pDNA release significantly improved the recovery of blood perfusion as compared with a bolus injection of VEGFencoding pDNA. This strategy to control the hydrogel degradation rate may be useful in regulating the delivery of a broad array of macromolecular drugs, and subsequently improve their therapeutic efficacy.",,The authors thank the NIH (RO1 DE013033 and RO1 HL069957) for the financial support of this research.

The present study attempts to elucidate the reasons for this difference in stability. The transformation of form II was investigated by powder X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, gravimetric moisture sorption, thermogravimetry, and vibrational spectroscopy. Solution-grown form II was found to be always contaminated with form I nuclei but still transforms much faster than corresponding physical mixtures of the pure forms in high RH, at a rate that is depending on the RH and the size of the crystals. A 0.1–0.6% w/w mass loss, inversely related to the initial monoclinic content, was observed during transformation of solution-grown form II, and was found to be due to residual ethanol that could not be removed by grinding, indicating incorporation by a solid solution mechanism. Moisture triggers the growth of existing form I nuclei but it exerts a weaker effect on nucleation, and the presence of residual ethanol greatly accelerates the transformation.",,"The authors thank Dr. M.

Carbopol® 974P was incorporated into an EUDRAGIT® L 100-55 carrier matrix at concentrations of 20% and 40% based on polymer weight with the aim of prolonging supersaturated ITZ release from the enteric matrix. Amorphous solid dispersions of ITZ in EUDRAGIT® L 100-55 containing either 20% or 40% Carbopol® 974P were produced by hot-melt extrusion (HME). Solid state analysis of these compositions was performed using differential scanning calorimetry and qualitative energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Dissolution analysis was conducted using a pH change method. Oral absorption of ITZ was evaluated in male Sprague–Dawley rats. Solid state analysis demonstrated that the extruded compositions were entirely amorphous and homogenous with respect to drug distribution in the polymer matrix. Dissolution analysis revealed that the addition of Carbopol® 974P to the EUDRAGIT® L 100-55 carrier system functioned to prolong the release of supersaturated levels of ITZ from the EUDRAGIT® L 100-55 matrix following an acidic-to-neutral pH transition. In vivo evaluation of ITZ absorption revealed that the addition of Carbopol® 974P substantially reduced the absorption variability seen with the EUDRAGIT® L 100-55 carrier system. In addition, the 20% Carbopol® 974P formulation exhibited a five-fold improvement in absorption over our initially reported ITZ particulate dispersion compositions that limited supersaturation of ITZ primarily to the stomach. The results of this study strongly suggest that substantial improvements in oral antifungal therapy with ITZ can be achieved via intestinal targeting and polymeric stabilization of supersaturation.",,The authors would like to thank Dr. J.

Immune stimulatory CpG dinucleotides, present within the plasmid DNA of the polyplexes are likely to contribute to this. The effect of CpG replacement on the levels of transgene expression was studied, after the i.v. administration of polyethylenimine (PEI) polyplexes. Tumor transfection and immune stimulation of PEI polyplexes containing plasmid DNA encoding for luciferase and rich in CpG motifs was monitored and compared to polyplexes containing the same gene but devoid of CpG motifs. Lipoplexes based on 1,2-dioleyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane/dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine liposomes were included as a control. The replacement of CpGrich DNA by CpGfree DNA did neither affect the physical properties of the DNA complexes nor did it affect their   transfection activity or cytotoxicity. The immune stimulation (interleukin-12) after i.v. administration of the PEI DNA complexes was low and unaffected by the presence of CpG motifs. The absence of CpG motifs within the different DNA complexes improved the degree and the duration of organ and tumor gene expression.

In a second set of experiments, permeability of the major active metabolite 6-β-naltrexol base (NTXOL) in the primarily unionized (unprotonated) form at pH 8.5 was compared to the ionized form (pH 4.5). 
                             fluxes of NTX, NTX·HCl and ionized and unionized NTXOL were measured through microneedle treated or intact full thickness human and GP skin using a flow through diffusion apparatus. Solubility and diffusion samples were analyzed by HPLC. Both GP and human skin show significant increases in flux when treated with 100 MN insertions as compared to intact full thickness skin when treated with NTX·HCl or ionized NTXOL (pH 4.5;   < 0.05). MN increased GP skin permeability for the hydrophilic HCL salt of NTX by tenfold and decreased lag time by tenfold too. Similar results were found using human skin, such that skin permeability to NTX·HCl was elevated to 7.0 × 10  cm/h. Permeability of the primarily unionized (unprotonated) form of NTXOL at pH 8.5 was increased by MN only threefold and lag time was only modestly reduced. However, MN treatment with the primarily ionized (protonated) form of NTXOL at pH 4.5 increased skin permeability fivefold and decreased lag time fourfold. Enhancement was observed   in both GP and human skin treated with MN compared to intact skin with the salt form of NTX and the ionized form of NTXOL.

PGE  was efficiently and stably embedded in the nanoparticles through interaction with iron, despite being relatively hydrophilic and having unstable chemical properties. Depending on the isomers and molecular weight of poly(lactic acid) selected, PGE  was gradually released from the nanoparticles at various rates into diluted serum  . Both stable retention of PGE  in the nanoparticles and coating of the nanoparticles with poly(ethylene glycol) led to an extremely extended blood residence time of PGE , as well as preferential accumulation in vascular lesions.

Given the emerging importance of using nanoparticles as a promising way to enhance the dissolution rate of these drugs, a method must be developed to adequately reflect the rate-change due to size reduction.

Four commonly-used methods (the paddle, rotating basket and flow-through cell from the US Pharmacopia, and a dialysis method) were employed to measure the dissolution rates of cefuroxime axetil as a model for nanodrug particles. Experimental rate ratios between the nanoparticles and their unprocessed form were 6.95, 1.57 and 1.00 for the flow-through, basket and paddle apparatus respectively. In comparison, the model-predicted value was 7.97. Dissolution via dialysis was rate-limited by the membrane. The data showed the flow-through cell to be unequivocally the most robust dissolution method for the nanoparticulate system.

Release of irinotecan and floxuridine from the liposomes was assessed using an  -release assay. Fluorescence, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and UV–Vis were used to characterize the aggregation state of the drugs within the liposomes. Coordinated release of the drugs from liposomes was disrupted by removing copper gluconate. Approximately 45% of the total irinotecan was detectable in the copper-containing CPX-1 formulation by NMR, which decreased to 19% without copper present in the liposomal interior. Formation of higher order, NMR-silent aggregates was associated with slower and uncoordinated irinotecan release relative to floxuridine and loss of the synergistic drug/drug ratio. Solution spectroscopy and calorimetry revealed that while all formulation components were required to achieve the highest solubility of irinotecan, direct drug-excipient binding interactions were absent. Long-range interactions between irinotecan, floxuridine and excipients modulate the aggregation state of irinotecan, allowing for simultaneous release of both drugs from the liposomes.",,The authors would like to thank Dr. Sharon Johnstone for helpful discussions and Brianne O’Callaghan for technical support.

The uptake and intracellular localization of the nanoparticle in SMC was examined using Z-stack fluorescent confocal microscopy. Anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of SMC were determined upon administration of PTX and CER, either as single agent or in combination, in aqueous solution and in PEO-PCL nanoparticle formulations. High encapsulation efficiencies (i.e., >95%) of PTX and CER at 10% ( / ) loading were attained in the PEO-PCL nanoparticles of around 270 nm in diameter. Fluorescence confocal analysis showed that nanoparticle delivery did facilitate cellular uptake and internalization. Additionally, combination of PTX and CER delivery in PEO-PCL nanoparticles was significantly more effective in decreasing the proliferation of SMC, probably by enhancing the apoptotic response.

They exert their action through binding to the cell surface receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and cause activation of Erk1/2 mediated mitogenic signaling in human prostate cancer (PCA) at both advanced and androgen-independent stages. Thus, we rationalized that inhibiting this mitogenic pathway could be useful in controlling advanced PCA growth. LNCaP and DU145 human PCA cells were treated with silibinin (100–200 μM) for different time points, and the levels of TGFα, activated signaling molecules (EGFR, Erk1/2 and Jnk1/2) and Erk1/2 kinase activity were analyzed employing ELISA, immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting techniques. The mRNA levels of TGFα were analyzed by RT-PCR. Treatment of cells (LNCaP and DU145) with silibinin resulted in a decrease in TGFα protein at both secreted and cellular levels together with a decrease in its mRNA level. Silibinin also caused an inhibition of EGFR activation followed by that of Erk1/2 without any change in their protein levels. The kinase activity of Erk1/2 to Elk1 was also inhibited by silibinin at least in DU145 cells. In other study, silibinin caused strong inhibition of Jnk1/2 activation in LNCaP cells while in DU145 cells, a strong induction in Jnk1/2 activation was observed. These results suggest that silibinin impairs TGFα-EGFR-Erk1/2 signaling in both androgen-dependent (LNCaP) and -independent (DU145) advanced human prostate carcinoma cells. This study, for the first time, identifies the inhibitory effect of silibinin on constitutively active TGFα-EGFR autocrine loop in advanced human PCA cells, which plausible contributes to the strong efficacy of silibinin in PCA prevention and intervention, as reported in recent studies.",epidermal growth factor receptor extracellular signal-regulated kinase c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase prostate cancer transforming growth factor-α,This work was supported by the NCI RO1 grant CA102514.,,2008

Cell viability was determined by trypan blue dye exclusion assay. Apoptosis induction was assessed by analysis of cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA fragmentation. Cell cycle distribution and generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were determined by flow cytometry. The effect of plumbagin treatment on cellular redox status was determined by analysis of intracellular glutathione (GSH) levels and expression of genes involved in ROS metabolism. Plumbagin treatment decreased viability of human prostate cancer cells (PC-3, LNCaP, and C4-2) irrespective of their androgen responsiveness or p53 status. Plumbagin-mediated decrease in cell viability correlated with apoptosis induction, which was accompanied by ROS generation and depletion of intracellular GSH levels. Pretreatment of cells with the antioxidant  -acetylcysteine inhibited plumbagin-mediated ROS generation and apoptosis. Plumbagin treatment also resulted in altered expression of genes responsible for ROS metabolism, including superoxide dismutase 2 (Mn-SOD).

In the perfused rat intestinal model, prenylated flavonoids with a monoglucosidic bond (e.g., icariin) was rapidly hydrolyzed into corresponding metabolites (e.g., baohuoside I). In the Caco-2 model, apical to basolateral permeability of a monoglycoside baohuoside I (1.46 × 10  cm/sec) was more than 2 folds greater than four prenylated flavonoids with 2 or more sugar moieties (<0.6 × 10  cm/sec). The slow apical to basolateral transport of baohuoside I was the result of efflux. This efflux was carrier-mediated and active since its transport was vectorial, concentration- and temperature-dependent with activation energies greater than 15 kcal/mol. Efflux of baohuoside I was significantly suppressed by inhibitors of BCRP and MRP2, whereas efflux of icariin was significantly inhibited only by p-glycoprotein inhibitor verapamil. Because YHH is often heat-processed for better efficacy, we determined and found the optimal condition for increasing contents of more bioavailable flavonoids (i.e., baohuoside I) to be 160–170°C for 5–7 min. Poor bioavailability of prenylated flavonoids results from their poor intrinsic permeation and transporter-mediated efflux. Heat processing parameters may be optimized to preserve the herb’s bioavailable flavonoids, which help retain and improve its efficacy during processing.",,,,2008

Release was also evaluated from microparticles confined within porous polymer scaffolds (composites).   and   studies were conducted using radiolabeled VEGF. The effect of VEGF dose on its fractional release from gelatin microparticles   was minimal, but the addition of collagenase to the buffer resulted in a higher cumulative release of VEGF. Gelatin crosslinking extent was a significant factor on release from both microparticles alone and composite scaffolds   and  . VEGF bioactivity from composite scaffolds   was maintained above 90% of the expected bioactivity over 14 days. VEGF release kinetics were dependent on the extent of gelatin crosslinking and were characteristic of the specific growth factor due to the effects of growth factor size, charge, and conformation on its complexation with gelatin.

The goal of the present study was to exploit the attractive features of synthetic hydrogels to elucidate the role of gel structure and chemistry in regulating biomechanical cues. Cartilage cells were encapsulated in poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels with different crosslinking densities. Cellular deformation was examined as a function of gel crosslinking. The effects of continuous   intermittent dynamic loading regimens were examined. RGD, a cell adhesion peptide, was incorporated into PEG gels and subjected to mechanical loading. Chondrocyte morphology and activity was assessed by anabolic and catabolic ECM gene expression and matrix production by collagen and glycosaminoglycan production. Cell deformation was mediated by gel crosslinking. In the absence of loading, anabolic activity was moderately upregulated while catabolic activity was significantly inhibited regardless of gel crosslinking. Dynamic loading enhanced anabolic activities, but continuous loading inhibited catabolic activity, while intermittent loading stimulated catabolic activity. RGD acted as a mechanoreceptor to influence tissue deposition.

A polyurethane containing an elastase-sensitive peptide sequence was processed into scaffolds by thermally induced phase separation. Processing conditions were manipulated to alter scaffold properties and anisotropy. The scaffold’s mechanical properties, degradation, and cytocompatibility using muscle-derived stem cells were characterized. Scaffold   degradation was evaluated by subcutaneous implantation. When heat transfer was multidirectional, scaffolds had randomly oriented pores. Imposition of a heat transfer gradient resulted in oriented pores. Both scaffolds were flexible and relatively strong with mechanical properties dependent upon fabrication conditions such as solvent type, polymer concentration and quenching temperature. Oriented scaffolds exhibited anisotropic mechanical properties with greater tensile strength in the orientation direction. These scaffolds also supported muscle-derived stem cell growth more effectively than random scaffolds. The scaffolds expressed over 40% weight loss after 56 days in elastase containing buffer. Elastase-sensitive scaffolds were complete degraded after 8 weeks subcutaneous implantation in rats, markedly faster than similar polyurethanes that did not contain the peptide sequence.

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 is the driving force behind renal fibrosis and has since long been regarded as the key factor to be targeted in prevention and treatment of renal fibrosis. Despite the impressive results obtained in experimental renal fibrosis, TGF-β1 blockade has not yet translated into an effective and safe therapeutic in human patients. Therefore, it remains important to explore the role of additional growth factors which are involved in renal regeneration and fibrosis. Recently, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) have both emerged as novel modulators of profibrotic TGF-β1 activity. The expression of BMP-7 is decreased in various models of renal disease, while CTGF is strongly upregulated in experimental and human renal fibrosis. In experimental kidney injury, administration of BMP-7 or inhibition of CTGF have been sufficient to result in striking improvement of renal function and structure.

Recent work suggests that BMP-7 can reverse the fibrotic effects of TGFβ but the underlying mechanism is unknown. We sought to determine BMP-7 signaling and its modulation of TGFβ induced fibrotic outcomes in adult human proximal tubule epithelial cells (PTECs). The effect of BMP-7 on phospho-p38 was assessed by Western blotting, p38 ELISA and Bio-plex phospho-protein assay. Secreted fibronectin (Fn) was measured by ELISA. BMP-7 had a concentration-dependent effect on intracellular signaling activating Smad 1/5/8 at higher concentrations and p38 mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase at lower concentrations in both primary and transformed PTECs; BMP-7 caused phosphorylation of p38 at 2.5 ng/ml and Smads at 200 ng/ml. Similarly, nuclear accumulation of phospho-p38 and Smad were observed at these respective concentrations. These results suggested an inverse relationship between activation of Smads and p38 MAP kinase in this context. Consistent, with this BMP7 at 200 ng/ml reduced TGFβ-induced p38 MAP activation and the p38-dependent TGFβ-induced Fn secretion by PTECs.

This peptide participates in kidney damage inducing fibrosis and epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT). Our aim was to describe potential therapeutic targets in AngII-induced EMT, investigating the blockade of different intracellular pathways. Studies were done in human tubular epithelial cells (HK2 cell line), evaluating changes in phenotype and EMT markers (Western blot and immunofluorescence). Treatment of HK2 cells with AngII for 3 days caused transdifferentiation into myofibroblast-like cells. The blockade of MAPKs cascade, using specific inhibitors of p38 (SB203580), extracellular signal-regulated kinase1/2 (ERK; PD98059) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (SP600125), diminished AngII-induced EMT. The blockade of RhoA/ROCK pathway, by transfection of a RhoA dominant-negative vector or by ROCK inhibition with Y-27632 or fasudil, inhibited EMT caused by AngII. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) is a downstream mediator of AngII-induced EMT. MAPKs and ROCK inhibitors blocked CTGF overexpression induced by AngII.

The purpose of this work was to determine the critical aspects in the stability of a steroid in the presence of a commonly used excipient, lactose. A steroid was either mixed or wet granulated with lactose with different particle size. Small lactose particles lead to a higher degree of degradation. Degradation was enhanced under warm humid conditions although the presence of water alone could not account for this effect. Lactose-phosphate, a known intrinsic contaminant in lactose is demonstrated to enhance the degradation of the steroid. Stability was improved in high purity lactose and deteriorated upon extra addition of phosphates. Since the exposure to the contaminant is a function of the surface area of the lactose, particle size differences of the excipient have a clear consequence. High shear granulated lactose granules exhibit a heterogeneous composition; large granules consist of small primary particles and vice versa. It is shown that the large granules, composed of the small primary lactose particles reveal the highest degree of degradation. Granule composition dictates the stability profile of the granules. The lactose contaminant and grandule composition dictates the stability profile of the granules and mixtures.",,The authors would like to thank Mr. K.

Single intravenous injection of levofloxacin as well as conjugated levofloxacin exhibited antibiotic effects in the osteomyelitis mouse model; conversely, neither conjugated nor non-conjugated norfloxacin was effective. The antibiotic effect of conjugated levofloxacin persisted to at least 6 days after injection, whereas the effect of non-conjugated levofloxacin was temporary.

PEG-OEI-MK showed efficient DNA binding as analyzed by ethidium bromide exclusion, resulting in formation of polyplexes with sizes around 100 nm and surface charges of below 5 mV zeta potential. This surface shielding of PEG-OEI-MK polyplexes remained stable at neutral pH 7.4, while polyplexes deshielded and aggregated at pH 5 within 15–30 min. Cell culture experiments demonstrated reduced polymer toxicity compared to the non-PEGylated OEI-MK. Transfection experiments demonstrated reduced gene expression of PEG-OEI-BM compared with the non-PEGylated analog OEI-BM, whereas the pH-reversible polymer PEG-OEI-MK mediated a significant increased transfection efficiency over the non-PEGylated OEI-MK. PEG-OEI-MK mediated the highest gene transfer at lowest cytotoxicity levels and also best   biocompatibility.","alkaline phosphatase aspartate aminotransferase 1,8-bis-maleimidodiethyleneglycol dichloro methane ethidium bromide fetal calf serum Hepes buffered glucose (5% ( / ) glucose, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4) Hepes buffered salt (2.5% glucose ( / ), 75 mM NaCl, 20 mM Hepes, pH 7.4)

431,,,[],"Gene delivery from biomaterials has become an important tool in tissue engineering. The purpose of this study was to generate a gene vector-doted fibrin glue as a versatile injectable implant to be used in gene therapy supported tissue regeneration. Copolymer-protected polyethylenimine(PEI)-DNA vectors ( ), naked DNA and PEI-DNA were formulated with the fibrinogen component of the fibrin glue TISSUCOL® and lyophilized. Clotting parameters upon rehydration and thrombin addition were measured, vector release from fibrin clots was determined. Structural characterizations were carried out by electron microscopy. Reporter and growth factor gene delivery to primary keratinocytes and chondrocytes   was examined. Finally,chondrocyte colonized clots were tested for their potency in cartilage regeneration in a osteochondral defect model. The optimized glue is based on the fibrinogen component of TISSUCOL®, a fibrin glue widely used in the clinics, co-lyophilized with copolymer-protected polyethylenimine(PEI)- DNA vectors ( ). This material, when rehydrated, forms vector-containing clots   upon thrombin addition and is suitable to mediate growth factor gene delivery to primary keratinocytes and primary chondrocytes admixed before clotting. Unprotected PEI-DNA in the same setup was comparatively unsuitable for clot formation while naked DNA was ineffective in transfection. Naked DNA was released rapidly from fibrin clots (>70% within the first seven days) in contrast to   which remained tightly immobilized over extended periods of time (0.29% release per day). Electron microscopy of chondrocytecolonized  -clots revealed avid endocytotic vector uptake.   BMP-2 gene transfection and subsequent expression in chondrocytes grown in   clots resulted in the upregulation of alkaline phosphatase expression and increased extracellular matrix formation  .  -fibrinogen preparations with admixed autologous chondrocytes when clotted   in osteochondral defects in the patellar grooves of rabbit femura gave rise to luciferase reporter gene expression detectable for two weeks (n=3 animals per group).

We were interested in studying the effect of a chemical change of the central block of pluronic polymers on the transfection activity. We synthesized new amphiphilic copolymers in which the hydrophobic pPO block was replaced by poly(tetrahydrofuran) (pTHF) chains. The resulting triblock pEO–pTHF–pEO polymers have been characterized by NMR and SEC and assayed for   and   gene transfer. The animal experiments showed that the new copolymers are able to significantly increase the transfection efficiency of plasmid DNA after intramuscular injection.

436,,,[],"To investigate the chemopreventive potential of resveratrol, a phytoalexin found in seeds and skin of grapes, berries and peanuts in 7,12 dimethyl benz(a)anthracene (DMBA) induced mouse skin tumorigenesis. Topical treatment of resveratrol was given to the animals 1 h prior to DMBA for 28 weeks. At the end of the study period, the skin tumors were dissected out and western blotting was carried out to examine the regulation of proteins involved in anti-tumorigenesis in response to resveratrol. Chemopreventive properties of resveratrol were reflected by delay in onset of tumorigenesis, reduced cumulative number of tumors, and reduction in tumor volume. Results of the western blotting showed that resveratrol treatment increased the DMBA suppressed p53 and Bax while decreased the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin. Further, resveratrol supplementation resulted in release of cytochrome C, caspases activation, increase in apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) as mechanism of apoptosis induction. Resveratrol was also found to inhibit skin tumorigenesis through regulation of Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/ and AKT proteins which are implicated in cancer progression because it stimulates proliferation and suppresses apoptosis. Based on the results we can conclude that resveratrol regulates apoptosis and cell survival in mouse skin tumors as mechanism of chemoprevention hence deserve to be a chemopreventive agent.",,"Authors are thankful to Dr. Ashwani Kumar, Director Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, (Council for Scientific & Industrial Research, India) for his keen interest in the study.

438,,,[],"Accumulating evidence from epidemiologic and clinical studies indicates that chronic inflammatory disorders harbor an increased risk of cancer development. Curcumin (CUR) has been strongly linked to the anti-inflammatory effect. On the other hand, isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane (SFN) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) are strong phase-II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes inducer. Therefore it is interesting to see if combination of these drugs can inhibit inflammation with higher combined efficacies. We used nitric oxide (NO) assay to assess the synergism of the different combinations of CUR, SFN and PEITC. The inflammatory markers, e.g. iNOS, COX-2, prostaglandin E  (PGE ), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) levels were determined using RT-PCR, Western blot and ELISA assays. We report that combination of PEITC + SFN or CUR + SFN has a synergistic effect in down-regulating inflammation markers like TNF, IL-1, NO, PGE . The synergism is probably due to the synergistic induction of phase II/antioxidant enzymes including heme-oxygenase1 (HO-1) and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1).

440,,,[],"To determine if particle shape can be engineered to inhibit phagocytosis of drug delivery particles by macrophages, which can be a significant barrier to successful therapeutic delivery. Non-spherical polystyrene particles were fabricated by stretching spherical particles embedded in a polymer film. A rat alveolar macrophage cell line was used as model macrophages. Phagocytosis of particles was assessed using time-lapse video microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. We fabricated worm-like particles with very high aspect ratios (>20). This shape exhibits negligible phagocytosis compared to conventional spherical particles of equal volume. Reduced phagocytosis is a result of decreasing high curvature regions of the particle to two single points, the ends of the worm-like particles. Internalization is possible only at these points, while attachment anywhere along the length of the particles inhibits internalization due to the low curvature. Shape-induced inhibition of phagocytosis of drug delivery particles is possible by minimizing the size-normalized curvature of particles. We have created a high aspect ratio shape that exhibits negligible uptake by macrophages.",,"Authors acknowledge Alejandro Sanchez, Santosh Gupta, and Poornima Kolhar for assistance.

441,,,[],"Based on a unique phase alignment that occurs during formulation, we postulated that PEG-ylation of the cargo enzyme would enhance its encapsulation within diblock copolymer nanocarriers and thus resistance to proteases. A freeze–thaw modified double emulsion technique was utilized to encapsulate either the catalytically active enzyme catalase (MW ∼250 kDa) or PEG-catalase in PEG–PLA polymer nanocarriers (PNC). Spectrophotometer measurement of substrate depletion was utilized to monitor enzyme activity. Isotope labeling of the enzyme was used in conjunction with activity measurements to determine PNC loading efficiency and PNC-enzyme resistance to proteases. This labeling also enabled blood clearance measurements of PNC-loaded and non-loaded enzymes in mice. Non-loaded PEG-catalase exhibited longer circulation times than catalase, but was equally susceptible to proteolysis. Modulation of the ratio of relatively hydrophilic to hydrophobic domains in the diblock PEG–PLA copolymer provided either filamentous or spherical PNC loaded with PEG-catalase. For both PNC geometries, encapsulation and resistance to proteases of the resultant PNC-loaded enzyme were more effective for PEG-catalase than catalase. Isotope tracing showed similar blood levels of PNC-loaded and free PEG-catalase in mice.

Functional impairment owing to inhibition of ABCG2 by drugs or its genetic polymorphisms may lead to the disruption of porphyrin homeostasis, which in turn causes cellular toxicity. We evaluated the impact on photosensitivity of the inhibition by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors of ABCG2 function. For this purpose, we established new methods for photosensitivity assays by using Flp-In-293 cells and plasma membrane vesicles prepared from Sf9 insect cells. With the new methods, we subsequently tested CDK inhibitors, i.e., purvalanol A, WHI-P180, bohemine, roscovitine, and olomoucine. Among CDK inhibitors tested, purvalanol A was found to be the most potent inhibitor (IC  = 3.5 μM) for ABCG2-mediated hematoporphyrin transport. At a concentration of 2.5 μM, it evoked the photosensitivity of ABCG2-expressing Flp-In-293 cells treated with pheophorbide a. WHI-P180 moderately inhibited ABCG2 function, exhibiting weak phototoxicity. In contrast, the phototoxicity of bohemine, roscovitine, and olomoucine were minimal in our assay system.

457,,,[],"Geldanamycin and its analogues belong to a new class of anticancer agents that inhibit the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90. We hypothesized that membrane transporters expressed on tumor cells may contribute at least in part to cellular sensitivity to these agents. The purpose of this study is to identify novel transporters as determinant for sensitivity and resistance to geldanamycins. To facilitate a systematic study of chemosensitivity across multiple geldanamycin analogues, we correlated mRNA expression profiles of majority of transporters with anticancer drug activities in 60 human tumor cell lines (NCI-60). We subsequently validated the gene–drug correlations using cytotoxicity and transport assays. The GA analogues displayed negative correlations with mRNA expression levels of the multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1). Suppressing MRP1 efflux using the inhibitor MK-571 and small interfering RNA in cell lines with intrinsic and acquired MRP1 overexpression (A549 and HL-60/ADR) and in cell lines stably transduced with MRP1 (MCF7/MRP1) increased intracellular drug accumulation and increased tumor cell sensitivity to geldanamycin analogues. These results suggest that elevated expression of MRP1, like the alternative efflux transporter MDR1 (ABCB1, P-glycoprotein), can significantly influence tumor cell sensitivity to geldanamycins as a potential chemoresistance factor.","ATP-binding cassette Developmental Therapeutics Program geldanamycin heat shock protein 90 heat shock protein 90 mechanism of action (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)2Htetrazolium, inner salt) the National Cancer Institute sulforhodamine B MK-571","This work was supported by NIH grant GM61390, the Food and Drug Administration and Western University of Health Sciences.

These amphiphilic graft polyphosphazenes PNDGP were synthesized via thermal ring-opening polymerization and subsequent two-step substitution reaction of hydrophilic and hydrophobic side groups. Micellization behavior in an aqueous phase was confirmed by fluorescence technique, DLS and TEM. Doxorubicin (DOX) was physically loaded into micelles by dialysis or O/W emulsion method. CLSM and MTT test were applied to observe intracellular drug distribution and determine cytotoxicity of drug-loaded micelles on Hela and HepG2 cells lines, respectively. A series of PNDGPs with controlled substitution ratios were obtained. Poly(NIPAm-co-DMAA) can act as hydrophilic segments in micellular system since its LCST was over 37°C when PNIPAm was copolymerized with DMAA. The CMC value was decreased with the increase of Glyet content. In addition, more hydrophobic group content introduced into the polymer would facilitate DOX encapsulation into the micelle. DOX-loaded micelle could achieve comparative cytotoxicity as free drug via endocytosis and succedent drug release into cytoplasm of cancer cells. The results suggest that these polymers might be used as potential carriers of hydrophobic anti-tumor drug for cancer therapy.",,This work was financially supported by National Natural Science Foundation (No. 30873203) and Project Foundation (No. J200702961108).,,2009

Sixty-nine patients with hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg/day of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for 12 weeks. Inflammatory biomarkers, including highsensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and endothelin (ET-1), plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and plasma tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), adiponectin, and lipid profiles were measured before and after statin therapy. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin both lowered levels of hs-CRP, MMP-9, PAI-1, total cholesterol (TC), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline values, with rosuvastatin lowering TC and LDL-C to a greater extent than atorvastatin (  < 0.05). Adiponectin level increase was 15% higher than that at baseline with atorvastatin (  > 0.05) but 67% higher with rosuvastatin (  < 0.05). Therapy with both statins not only significantly improved lipid profiles but also decreased levels of vascular biomarkers hs-CRP, MMP-9, and PAI-1; however, only rosuvastatin increased serum adiponectin levels significantly in patients with hypercholesterolemia, which could imply a beneficial effect in coronary artery disease.",,This work was supported by The National Basic Research Program (973 Program) 2006CB503803 and HI-TECH Technique and Development Program of China (863 Program) 2007AA02Z448.,,2009
460,,,[],"This study aims to develop a characterization method for coating structure based on image analysis, which is particularly promising for the rational design of coated particles in the pharmaceutical industry. The method applies the MATLAB image processing toolbox to images of coated particles taken with Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CSLM). The coating thicknesses have been determined along the particle perimeter, from which a statistical analysis could be performed to obtain relevant thickness properties, e.g. the minimum coating thickness and the span of the thickness distribution. The characterization of the pore structure involved a proper segmentation of pores from the coating and a granulometry operation. The presented method facilitates the quantification of porosity, thickness and pore size distribution of a coating. These parameters are considered the important coating properties, which are critical to coating functionality. Additionally, the effect of the coating process variations on coating quality can straight-forwardly be assessed. Enabling a good characterization of the coating qualities, the presented method can be used as a fast and effective tool to predict coating functionality. This approach also enables the influence of different process conditions on coating properties to be effectively monitored, which latterly leads to process tailoring.",,"The authors would like to thank Friesland Food Research Centre Deventer, The Netherlands, especially Drs.

Reliable prediction of high affinity binders with this receptor would be valuable for pharmaceutical drug discovery to predict potential toxicological responses Computational models were developed and validated for a dataset consisting of human PXR (PXR) activators and non-activators. We used support vector machine (SVM) algorithms with molecular descriptors derived from two sources,   and the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) application software. We also employed the molecular docking program GOLD in which the GoldScore method was supplemented with other scoring functions to improve docking results. The overall test set prediction accuracy for PXR activators with SVM was 72% to 81%. This indicates that molecular shape descriptors are useful in classification of compounds binding to this receptor. The best docking prediction accuracy (61%) was obtained using 1D   descriptors as a weighting factor to the GoldScore.

464,,,[],"To investigate whether conjunctival epithelial cells express transport processes for opioid peptides. We monitored the uptake of [ H]deltorphin II and [ H]DADLE, two hydrolysis-resistant synthetic opioid peptides, in the rabbit conjunctival epithelial cell line CJVE and elucidated the characteristics of the uptake process. CJVE cells express robust uptake activity for deltorphin II and DADLE. Both opioid peptides compete with each other for transport. Several endogenous and synthetic opioid peptides, but not non-peptide opioid antagonists, are recognized by the transport process. Though various peptides inhibit the uptake of deltorphin II and DADLE in a similar manner, the uptake of deltorphin II is partly Na -dependent whereas that of DADLE mostly Na -independent. The transport process shows high affinity for many endogenous/synthetic opioid peptides. Functional features reveal that this transport process may be distinct from the opioid peptide transport system described in the retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 and also from the organic anion transporting polypeptides, which are known to transport opioid peptides. CJVE cells express a novel, hitherto unknown transport process for endogenous/synthetic opioid peptides.

An   platelet aggregation assay showed that C2 inhibited aggregation only after pre-incubation in serum, suggesting that C2 is a prodrug of PGE .  , intravenous administration of C2 caused increase in cutaneous blood flow. In the presence of zinc ions, all of the synthesized PGE  phosphate derivatives could be encapsulated in PLA-nanoparticles. Use of  -PLA instead of  -PLA, and high molecular weight PLA resulted in a slower release of C2 from the nanoparticles. We consider that C2-encapsulated nanoparticles prepared with  -PLA and PEG- -PLA have good sustained-release profile of PGE , which is useful clinically.","9-anthryldiazomethane adenosine 5′-diphosphate alkaline phosphatase Δ -9- -butyryl prostaglandin F  butyl ester dibenzyl  . -diisopropyl phosphoramidite PGE

Three poly-(ε-caprolactone) (CAPA) formulations were examined to assess the impact of particle size. Three other formulations, based on cellulose acetate butyrate (CAB), CAPA and polystyrene were studied to address the role of polymer hydrophobicity.   skin permeation, and confocal microscopy and stratum corneum (SC) tape-stripping were used to evaluate the cutaneous disposition of NR. NR delivery into the SC was greater from the larger particles, the overall smaller surface area of which enhanced the “leaving tendency” of the lipophilic “active”. Skin uptake of NR (measured as “%payload released”) from polystyrene, CAPA and CAB particles increased with decreasing polymer hydrophobicity (polystyrene > CAPA > CAB) as expected. Confocal microscopy revealed that NR released from the particles accumulated in, and penetrated via, lipid domains between the SC corneocytes. The particles showed affinity for hairs, and concentrated on the skin surface at the follicular openings. Delivery of a model drug to the skin from sub-micron polymeric particle formulations is sensitive to the particle size and the relative hydrophobicity of the carrier.",cellulose acetate butyrate poly-(ε-caprolactone) laser scanning confocal microscopy Nile Red polydispersity index polystyrene stratum corneum transepidermal water loss,Supported by the European Commission 6th Research and Technological Development Framework Programme (NAPOLEON: NAnostructured waterborne POLymEr films with OutstaNding properties) and a University Research Scholarship for Xiao Wu.,,2009

The propose of this work was to develop a controlled release delivery system for stratifin that can be applied at the time of wound closure to release stratifin and stimulate the expression of MMP-1 in a sustained manner over the late stages of wound healing (after 3 days). Stratifin was complexed to chitosan particles, which were then encapsulated in PLGA microspheres and blended into crosslinked hyaluronic acid films.   release was assessed using fluorescent-tagged stratifin, cytotoxity by MTT assay and bioactivity by measuring the levels of MMP-1 expression in cultured fibroblasts. The release of stratifin was delayed for 3 days and then controlled for 30 days so that 60% of the total stratifin loaded was released. The released protein significantly stimulated the expression of MMP-1 in cultured fibroblasts without compromising cell viability. By complexing to chitosan, the initial burst release was reduced, so that only 5% of stratifin was released in 3 days. This stratifin delivery sytem has the potential to be used as an anti-fibrogenic factor-associated wound insert for improving post-surgical scarring in closed wound.",,This work was supported by CIHR and BC Professional Firefighter’s fund.

It is essential to maintain the appropriate solid state form of the drug during processing and over the lifetime of the product. The aim of this study was to investigate the contributing factors in the process of disproportionation, whereby the salt converts back to the free form of the drug. Infrared and Raman spectroscopy were used to detect and quantify the formation of free base in physical mixtures with excipients. The pH-solubility relationships were determined based on measured salt solubilities and properties of the free form. The mesylate salts of two model pharmaceutical compounds were found to disproportionate to the free base form when physically mixed with certain common basic excipients and exposed to moderate relative humidities. In contrast, the napsylate salts were much more resistant to disproportionation. The napsylate salts had solubilities more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than the respective mesylate salts, and showed little to no detectable formation of free base. The mesylate salts with higher solubilities showed significant levels of conversion to the free base. It appears that both the solubility and pH  (the pH of a solution where there is saturation of both ionized and unionized species) of the salts, as well as the base solubility, play important roles in determining the susceptibility of salts to disproportionate. The extent of conversion was also affected by excipient properties, including basicity, solubility, physical state and surface area.",,The authors acknowledge AstraZeneca R&D Lund Sweden for funding this research.

PLA particles penetrated into 50% of the vellus hair follicles, reaching a maximal depth corresponding to the entry of the sebaceous gland in 12–15% of all observed follicles. The accumulation of particles in the follicular ducts was accompanied by the release of dye to the viable epidermis and its retention in the sebaceous glands for up to 24 h. Kinetic studies   as well as in skin explants revealed, that, although stable in aqueous solution, destabilization of the particles and significant release of incorporated dye occurred upon contact with organic solvents and the skin surface.

DOX release from PPCD conjugates followed an acid-triggered manner and increased with increasing PEGylation degree.   cytotoxicity of PPCD conjugates against ovarian cancer (SKOV-3) cells increased, while cellular uptake decreased with increasing PEGylation degree. PPSD conjugates released negligible drug at any tested pH condition and were less cytotoxic. The conjugates were internalized by SKOV-3 cells via clathrin-mediated and adsorptive endocytosis, and were delivered to acidic lysosomes where DOX was released from PPCD conjugates and diffused into the nuclei. PPCD conjugates with highest PEGylation degree showed the highest tumor accumulation in mice inoculated with SKOV-3 cells.

Genistein has been found to be responsible for lowering the rate of pancreatic cancer. However, the molecular mechanisms by which genistein elicits its effects on pancreatic cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to elucidate the anti-cancer mechanism(s) of genistein. Multiple molecular techniques, such as Real-time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, invasion assay, immunofluorescence assay, gene transfection, MTT assay, and Histone/DNA ELISA, were used. We found that genistein inhibited cell growth accompanied by induction of apoptosis with concomitant attenuation of FoxM1 and its downstream genes, such as survivin, cdc25a, MMP-9, and VEGF, resulting in the inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell invasion. We also found that down-regulation of FoxM1 by siRNA prior to genistein treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. This is the first report showing the molecular role of FoxM1 in mediating the biological effects of genistein in pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting that FoxM1 could be a novel target for the treatment of pancreatic cancer.","Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay Forkhead box protein M1 Matrix metalloproteinases 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide Reverse transcription-PCR Vascular endothelial growth factor","This work was partly funded by grants from the National Cancer Institute, NIH (R01CA131151 and R01CA132794) to F.H.S.

CT images of the liver have been improved by encapsulating currently used, water-soluble iodine contrast agent in liposomes. The present study was performed to investigate a possibility to overcome the limitations of entrapped iodine in liposomes by preparing liposomes co-loaded with iopamidol, a water-soluble iodinated compound, and lipiodol, an iodized oil. Iopamidol and lipiodol were simultaneously loaded in liposomes by modified reverse-phase evaporation method. The entrapped iodine concentration, mean particle size and polydispersity index of resulting liposomes were evaluated. Following intravenous injection of these liposomes into rats, CT scanning was performed. Simultaneous loading of iopamidol and lipiodol into liposomes resulted in entrapped iodine concentrations as high as 49.2 iodine mg/ml. The mean particle size was 280 nm, and the mean polydispersity index was 0.230. CT scanning with these iopamidol/lipiodol (I/L) liposomes into rats resulted in more pronounced and more persistent increases in RES-rich organs, liver and spleen, compared with free liposomes or liposomes loaded with iopamidol alone.

492,,,[],"The narrow efficacy-toxicity window of anticancer agents necessitates understanding of factors contributing to their disposition. This is especially true for camptothecins as they exist in the lactone and carboxylate forms with each moiety differentially interacting with efflux or uptake transporters. Here we determined the disposition of the lactone and carboxylate forms of AR-67, a 3  generation camptothecin analogue. Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats given intravenous boluses of AR-67 lactone or carboxylate with or without pharmacologic inhibitor pretreatment (GF120918 or rifampin). Pharmacokinetic modeling was used to estimate clearances, while simulations assessed the impact of clearance changes on overall AR-67 exposure. Our modeling showed that carboxylate clearance was 3.5-fold higher than that of the lactone. GF120918 decreased lactone clearance only, but rifampin decreased both lactone and carboxylate clearances. Simulations showed that decreasing carboxylate clearance, which controls the overall drug disposition, leads to significant increase in AR-67 exposure. The apparent   blood stability of AR-67 is partly dependent on the increased carboxylate clearance. This may have clinical implications for populations with single nucleotide polymorphisms that impair the function of uptake transporter genes (e.g., SLCO1B1), which are potentially responsible for AR-67 carboxylate clearance.",area under the plasma concentration   time curve breast cancer resistance protein organic anion transporting polypeptide p-glycoprotein United States Pharmacopeia,This work was supported in part by the National Institutes of Health (RCA123867A) and research grants from Arno Therapeutics.,,2010

Liposomes offer the advantage of a high drug payload, decreased drug toxicity and enhanced drug accumulation at tumor sites. Increased accumulation is due to the relatively leaky tumor vasculature that allows liposome extravasation. Between different types of tumors and even within one tumor, vascular permeability and thus liposome extravasation may differ greatly. Furthermore, upon accumulation of liposomes in the tumor area, drug bioavailability is not guaranteed. At present, these are the major issues for clinically used liposomal drugs. Mild hyperthermia (HT), the heating of tumor tissue to temperatures of up to 43°C, has been developed in the past decades as an established and efficacious treatment modality in combination with chemo- and radiotherapy. HT can be used to further improve liposomal chemotherapy in two ways: HT is known to increase vascular permeability in solid tumors and may therefore increase levels of liposome accumulation, and thermosensitive liposomes have been developed that can be triggered to release their contents upon hyperthermia. By applying these two strategies, drug delivery to tumors can be strongly enhanced.",,"This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.",,2010

The complexity of the luminal environment and the value of dissolution in lyophilized products were also highlighted. The second session of the conference included presentations on the Biopharmaceutics Classification Scheme (BCS), the Biopharmaceutics Drug Disposition Classification System (BDDCS), and the role of transporters in the classification of drugs. The current status of biowaivers and a modern view on non-linear  –  (IVIVC) correlations were also addressed. Finally, this section ended with a special topic on biorelevant dissolution media and methods. The third day of the conference was dedicated to bioequivalence. Emphasis was placed on high within-subject variability and its impact on study design. Two unresolved issues of bioequivalence were also discussed: the use of generic antiepileptic drugs and the role of metabolites in bioequivalence assessment. Finally, the conference closed with a presentation of the current regulatory status of WHO and EMEA.",,,,2010

Samples processed at different milling energies are characterized, and annealing studied. Molecular mobility in micronized drug substance was studied using TSC and compared to results from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The micronized drug substance TSC spectra are compared to crystalline and amorphous references. TSC shows distinct relaxation modes for micronized material in comparison to a single weak exotherm observed with DSC. Molecular mobility modes are unique for micronized material compared to the amorphous reference indicating physically distinct disorder compared to phase-separated amorphous material. Signals are ascribed as arising from crystal defects. TSC differentiates material processed at different milling energies showing reasonable correlation between the AUC of the α-relaxation and micronization energy. The annealing process of crystal defects in micronized drug appears to proceed differently for α and β relaxations. TSC proves sensitive to the crystal defects in the micronized drug substance studied here. The technique is able to differentiate distinct types of disorder and can be used to characterize noncrystalline regions arising from milling processes which are physically distinct from amorphous material.",,The authors wish to thank Shadi Madieh for supplying the micronized samples processed at different milling energies.

The DOX-sensitive MES-SA uterine sarcoma cell line was used as a negative control. The two resistant cell lines were uterine sarcoma MES-SA/Dx5, which overexpresses the multidrug resistance exporter P-glycoprotein, and ovarian carcinoma SKOV-3, which is less sensitive to doxorubicin due to a p53 gene mutation. The cellular uptake, subcellular localization and cytotoxicity of the two agents when delivered via nanoparticles (NPs) were compared to their free-form administration. The cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of DOX delivered by NPs were comparable to the free form in MES-SA and SKOV-3, but much higher in MES-SA/Dx5, indicating the capability of the NPs to overcome P-glycoprotein resistance mechanisms. NP-encapsulated ICG showed slightly different subcellular localization, but similar fluorescence intensity when compared to free ICG, and retained the ability to generate heat for hyperthermia delivery.

513,,,[],"Although Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is required for endodermal commitment and hepatogenesis, the possibility that it regulates liver injury after ischemia reperfusion (I/R) has not been considered. Therefore, we determined the expression pattern of Hh signaling and its role in liver injury following I/R using Hh antagonist cyclopamine (CYA). Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups. Sham group underwent a sham operation with no liver I/R. Vehicle or CYA preconditioned I/R groups underwent liver ischemia for 90 min followed by reperfusion for 1 h. Liver tissue and blood were analyzed for gene expression, histological and biochemical evaluation. Hedgehog ligands were upregulated after reperfusion injury. Serum levels of aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase, inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil infiltration, and tissue damage were significantly less in CYA-pretreated rats compared with vehicle-pretreated rats. CYA also decreased the phosphorylated form of JNK and ERK. This study provides evidence that endogenous Hh signaling is an early mediator of liver injury and inflammation after I/R. CYA abrogates normothermic I/R injury in rats by inhibiting the MAPK pathway and decreasing the acute inflammatory response.

To date, much of our understanding of these systems is obtained from studies of animal viruses. Application of plant viruses for drug delivery is in the nascent stage, but it is becoming apparent that plant viral particles can be engineered to possess novel properties to meet the unique requirements of targeted drug delivery. Chemical functionalization of a plant viral particle surface can impart stealth properties to prolong   circulation half-life and/or targeting capability to direct drug delivery to diseased tissues.

Prooxidant effect of PEITC was assessed by flow cytometry using a chemical probe and measurement of hydrogen peroxide production. Gene expression was determined by real-time PCR using Human Oxidative Stress and Antioxidant Defense RT  Profiler™. Protein expression was determined by Western blotting. The PEITC treatment resulted in generation of reactive oxygen species and hydrogen peroxide production in PC-3 human prostate cancer cells but not in a representative normal human prostate epithelial cell line (PrEC). Basal oxidative stress-antioxidant defense gene expression signature was strikingly different between PC-3 and PrEC cells. The PEITC treatment (2.5 μM, 6 h) caused up-regulation of 29 genes and down-regulation of 2 genes in PC-3 cells. Conversely, 4 genes were up-regulated, and 10 genes were down-regulated by a similar PEITC treatment in the PrEC cell line.

Our solution enables injections or infusions that are less invasive compared to subcutaneous injections and are leakage-free at the location of penetration. The intradermal interface is based on a 31-gauge cannula embedded in a slider, movable relative to a carrier plate that can easily be fixed onto the skin. By simply pushing the slider, the cannula is inserted into the dermis. We performed injections and infusions with stained water and polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution in   pig skin. The sizes of coloured spots in the skin range from 3.5 mm  to 15.4 mm  for stained water depending on the infused volume. Infusing stained PEG solution resulted in stained tissue areas about one order of magnitude larger. One of three investigated leakage modes is unacceptable but can be reliably avoided by proper site selection. At low flow rates and at the beginning of an infusion an initial back pressure overshoot was identified. This effect was identified as the limiting parameter for the design of small programmable or intelligent devices based on micro actuators.

The effect of heat pre-treatment of solutions used for spray-drying and the use of spray-dried copolymer as excipient for hot-melt extrusion was investigated. The solid dispersions were prepared at different drug-polymer ratios and analyzed with modulated differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. Miconazole either mixed with the PEG-fraction of the copolymer or crystallized in the same or a different polymorph as the starting material. The kinetic miscibility was higher for the solid dispersions obtained from solutions which were pre-heated compared to those spray-dried from solutions at ambient temperature. Hot-melt extrusion resulted in an even higher mixing capability. Here the use of the spray-dried copolymer did not show any benefit concerning the kinetic miscibility of the drug and copolymer, but it resulted in a remarkable decrease in the torque experienced by the extruder allowing extrusion at lower temperature and torque. The manufacturing method has an influence on the mixing capacity and phase behavior of solid dispersions.

A new approach of hydrogen/deuterium exchange was developed to separate and distinguish the specific impact of single freezing and F/T cycling on protein structure, using lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as model system. In the freezing process, a fraction of LDH molecules that was inversely dependent on protein concentration was observed to partially denature its structure. Local structural perturbations were localized by peptide level HX analysis to the surface residues in segments 91–132, 170–237 and 288–331. In contrast, F/T cycling led to irreversible LDH aggregation with global structural unfolding. Residual solvent-protected structure was only detected in the aggregates for three segments, 13–31, 109–117 and 133–143, that were coincident with the consensus aggregation hotspots predicted by four different algorithms. Results indicate freezing preferentially disturbs local structure at the surface residues, consistent with ice-solution interface-mediated denaturation mechanism.

537,,,[],"To study the potential impact of the degradation of Polysorbates (PS) 20 and 80 on the stability of therapeutic proteins in parenteral formulations. First, degradation products of PS20 and 80 were identified. Subsequently, the effect of degraded polysorbate on physical characteristics and long-term stability of protein formulations was assessed. Further, the impact of polysorbate degradation on protein stability was evaluated via shaking stress studies on formulations spiked with artificially degraded polysorbate or degradants like fatty acids. Additionally, aged formulations with reduced polysorbate content were shaken. The degradation of polysorbate leads to a buildup of various molecules, some of which are poorly soluble, including fatty acids and polyoxyethylene (POE) esters of fatty acids. Spiking studies showed that the insoluble degradants could potentially impact protein stability and that the presence of sufficient intact polysorbate was crucial to prevent this. End-of-shelf-life shaking of protein formulations showed that the stability of various monoclonal antibodies was, however, not affected. Although some degradants can potentially influence the stability of the protein (as discerned from spiking studies), degradation of polysorbates did not impact the stability of the different proteins tested in pharmaceutically relevant temperature and storage conditions.",,"The authors wish to thank Dr. Balz Fischer and B.

538,,,[],"The purpose of this study was to determine if non-specific COX inhibition could extend pore lifetime in hairless guinea pigs following microneedle treatment. Hairless guinea pigs were treated with microneedle arrays ± daily application of Solaraze® gel (3% diclofenac sodium (non-specific COX inhibitor) and 2.5% hyaluronic acid); transepidermal water loss was utilized to evaluate pore lifetime. To examine the permeation of naltrexone, additional guinea pigs were treated with microneedles ± daily Solaraze® gel followed by application of a 16% transdermal naltrexone patch; pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma naltrexone levels was performed. Histological analysis was employed to visualize morphological changes following microneedle and Solaraze® treatment. Animals treated with microneedles + Solaraze® displayed extended pore lifetime (determined by transepidermal water loss measurements) for up to 7 days. Enhanced naltrexone permeation was also observed for an extended amount of time in animals treated with microneedles + Solaraze®. No morphological changes resulting from microneedle treatment or COX inhibition were noted. Non-specific COX inhibition is an effective means of extending pore lifetime following microneedle treatment in hairless guinea pigs. This may have clinical implications for extending transdermal patch wear time and therefore increasing patient compliance with therapy.",,"We would like to thank Dr. Harvinder Gill and Dr. Mark Prausnitz at the Georgia Institute of Technology for generously providing the MN arrays used for this work.

542,,,[],"To critically evaluate the effect of submicron and micron-sized organic particulates on the ultraviolet (UV) absorption spectra of aqueous systems and assess the applicability of UV/Vis fiber-optic probes for   concentration monitoring in the presence of particles of different sizes. UV absorbance spectra were obtained for aqueous felodipine suspensions containing a range of particle sizes (300 nm–400 μm) and suspension concentrations and for methanolic solutions of different concentrations and amorphous films of different thicknesses. Select suspensions were further characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments. Mie theory was used to provide insight into the role of particle size on scattering and absorption of UV radiation. Large increases in absorbance as a function of total suspension concentration were observed for nanosuspensions but not for the other particle sizes evaluated. NMR measurements of solution concentration indicated that the observed increases in UV absorbance values for these systems were not caused by increases in the concentration of dissolved molecules, implying that nanoparticles of felodipine might absorb UV light. Mie theory-based calculations enabled reconstruction of the experimental observations and supported this hypothesis. For solutions containing small (submicron) felodipine particles, UV spectra were influenced by absorption of the particles and contributions from absorption of dissolved molecules and scattering of the particles. Caution should be applied when using   UV/VIS-probes to monitor the amount of dissolved material during dissolution, in particular when small particles are present (e.g. dissolution of nanoparticulate formulations) or generated (e.g. precipitation of supersaturated solutions) in the dissolution medium.",,"The authors would like to thank the National Science Foundation Engineering Research Center for Structured Organic Particulate Systems for financial support (NSF ERC-SOPS) (EEC-0540855).

This study was conducted to predict the human pharmacokinetics of Ab2.  PK profile of Ab2 in preclinical species and   mechanistic studies in preclinical and human systems were used for pharmacokinetic predictions. In Tg2576 and PSAPP mice that have ~100-fold higher circulating levels of human Aβ compared to humans, elimination of Ab2 was target-mediated, such that exposure was 5–10 fold lower compared to wild-type rodents or to PDAPP mice that have human Aβ concentrations in plasma similar to humans. In cynomolgus monkeys, the t  of Ab2 was faster (<2.5 days) compared to that of the control antibody (~13 days). The fast elimination of Ab2 in cynomolgus monkeys was linked to off-target binding to cynomolgus monkey fibrinogen that was also causing incomplete recovery of Ab2 in cynomolgus monkey serum in blood partitioning experiments. Ab2 had significantly weaker to undetectable binding to human (and mouse) fibrinogen and had good recovery in human serum in blood partitioning experiments.

A set of DTS was identified and cloned into EGFP-reporter plasmids controlled by the CMV-promoter. These pDNA constructs were delivered into A431 and HeLa cells using standard electroporation, pEI-based polyfection or lipofection methods. The amount of pDNA delivered into the nucleus was determined by qPCR; transfection efficiency was determined by flow cytometry. Neither of these DTS increased transgene expression. We varied several parameters (mitotic activity, applied dose and delivery strategy), but without effect. Although upregulated transgene expression was observed after stimulation with TNF-α, this effect could be ascribed to non-specific upregulation of transcription rather than enhanced nuclear import. Nuclear copy numbers of plasmids containing or lacking a DTS did not differ significantly after lipofectamine-based transfection in dividing and non-dividing cells. No beneficial effects of DTS on gene expression or nuclear uptake were observed in this study.",,"This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.",,2011

An effective stabilization method is essential for the success of polycationic nanoparticle-mediated siRNA delivery. In this study, sodium triphosphate (TPP), an ionic crosslinking agent, is used to stabilize siRNA-containing nanoparticles by co-condensation. siRNA and TPP were co-encapsulated into a block copolymer, poly(ethylene glycol)- -polyphosphoramidate (PEG- -PPA), to form ternary nanoparticles. Physicochemical characterization was performed by dynamic light scattering and gel electrophoresis. Gene silencing efficiency in cell lines was assessed by dual luciferase assay system. The PEG- -PPA/siRNA/TPP ternary nanoparticles exhibited high uniformity with smaller size (80–100 nm) compared with PEG- -PPA/siRNA nanoparticles and showed increased stability in physiological ionic strength and serum-containing medium, due to the stabilization effect from ionic crosslinks between negatively charged TPP and cationic PPA segment. Transfection and gene silencing efficiency of the TPP-crosslinked nanoparticles were markedly improved over PEG- -PPA/siRNA complexes in serum-containing medium.

Real-time RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis in HPHs showed that both CPA and IFO induced the expressions of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4. Notably, treatment of HPHs with CPA but not IFO resulted in significant nuclear accumulation of CAR, which represents the initial step of CAR activation. Further studies in HPHs demonstrated that selective inhibition of PXR by sulforaphane preferentially repressed IFO- over CPA-mediated induction of CYP2B6.

Receptor-blocking studies revealed that it was specifically taken up through the M6P/IGFII-receptor on fibroblasts, and it inhibited expression of fibrotic markers in activated HSC.  , liver drug levels were significantly higher after injection of Y27-conjugate as compared to Y27632, and the conjugate accumulated specifically in HSC. After acute CCl -induced liver injury, Y27-conjugate reduced the local activation of HSC, whereas an equimolar dose of free drug did not.

TDA and DLS were comparable in sizing non-stressed peptides and proteins in a concentration range of about 0.5 to 50 mg/ml. TDA performed well even at lower concentrations, where DLS tends to provide theoretically high values of the Z-average radius. However, because of differences in the detection physics, DLS was more weighted towards the detection of aggregates in stressed formulations than TDA. Advantageously, TDA was also able to size the small peptide oxytocin, which was not feasible by DLS.

Hot-melt-extruded felodipine and Eudragit  E PO systems at a range of compositions were studied after a standard period of aging to allow phase separation to occur. The samples were characterised using combined nano-thermal analysis, photothermal FTIR microspectroscopy coupled with pulsed force mode AFM as a novel characterisation approach. Crystalline felodipine presents in all formulations with drug loadings from 10–70% (w/w). In formulations with high drug loadings (50 and 70%), amorphous felodipine co-exists with crystalline forms, and higher drug concentration is observed in the centre compared to the outer surface of the extrudates. Drug crystal dimensions in extrudates with low drug loadings (10–30%) are small, in the micron to submicron range. We propose that uneven drug distribution is principally caused by processing-associated factors such as expansion of extrudates during extrusion.

This study examines gelation of a novel histamine H4 receptor antagonist that forms hydrogels spontaneously at room temperature. To elucidate the mechanism and structural moieties responsible for this unusual gelation, hydrogels were characterized by rheology, optical microscopy, and XRD. SEM was performed on xerogels; NMR measurements were conducted in gelator solutions in the presence of a gel-breaker. The influence of temperature, concentration, pH, and ionic strength on elastic and viscous moduli of the hydrogels was evaluated; gel points were established via thorough rheological criteria. The observed are “true” gels with a fibrillar texture and lamellar microstructure. On a molecular level, the gels are composed of aggregates of partially ionized species stabilized by hydrophobic interactions of aromatic moieties. The gel-to-sol transition occurs at physiologically relevant temperatures and is concentration-, pH-, and ionic strength-dependent. We hypothesize that this spontaneous gelation is due to the so-called “spring” effect, a high energy salt form that transiently increases aqueous solubility above its equilibrium limit.

Laser diffraction analysis and dissolution testing were used to validate the particle size that was found by CLSM. The particle size of the pure drug as determined by laser diffraction and CLSM were similar (D  of approximately 22 μm). CLSM showed that the dipyridamole crystals in the crystalline dispersion obtained by freeze-drying of less concentrated solutions were of sub-micron size (0.7 μm), whereas the crystals obtained by freeze-drying of more concentrated solutions were larger (1.3 μm). This trend in drug crystal size was in agreement with the dissolution behavior of the tablets prepared from these products. CLSM is a useful technique to determine the particle size in a powder mixture. Furthermore, CLSM can be used to determine the drug crystal size over a broad size distribution.

562,,,[],"To evaluate the advantages of amino acid/dipeptide monoester prodrugs for cancer treatments by assessing the uptake and cytotoxic effects of floxuridine prodrugs in a secondary cancer cell monolayer following permeation across a primary cancer cell monolayer. The first Capan-2 monolayer was grown on membrane transwell inserts; the second monolayer was grown at the bottom of a plate. The permeation of floxuridine and its prodrugs across the first monolayer and the uptake and cell proliferation assay on secondary layer were sequentially determined. All floxuridine prodrugs exhibited greater permeation across the first Capan-2 monolayer than the parent drug. The correlation between uptake and growth inhibition in the second monolayer with intact prodrug permeating the first monolayer suggests that permeability and enzymatic stability are essential for sustained action of prodrugs in deeper layers of tumors. The correlation of uptake and growth inhibition were vastly superior for dipeptide prodrugs to those obtained with mono amino acid prodrugs. Although a tentative general overall correlation between intact prodrug and uptake or cytotoxic action was obtained, it appears that a mixture of floxuridine prodrugs with varying beneficial characteristics may be more effective in treating tumors.",,We thank Dr. Wei Shen for his expertise with prodrug purification.

Using Eudragit L100, a pH-responsive polymer which dissolves at pH 6, hydrocortisone-loaded microparticles were produced by oil-in-oil microencapsulation or spray drying. Release and permeation of hydrocortisone from microparticles alone or in gels was assessed, and preliminary stability data was determined. Drug release from microparticles was pH-dependent, though the particles produced by spray drying also gave significant non-pH-dependent burst release, resulting from their porous nature or from drug enrichment on the surface of these particles. This pH-responsive release was maintained upon incorporation of the oil-in-oil microparticles into Carbopol- and HPMC-based gel formulations.   studies showed 4- to 5-fold higher drug permeation through porcine skin from the gels at pH 7 compared to pH 5. Permeation studies showed that the oil-in-oil-generated particles deliver essentially no drug at normal (intact) skin pH (5.0–5.5) but that delivery can be triggered and targeted to atopic dermatitis skin where the pH is elevated. The incorporation of these microparticles into Carbopol- and HPMC-based aqueous gel formulations demonstrated good stability and pH-responsive permeation into porcine skin.",,"The authors thank Stiefel laboratories Ltd., a GSK company, for their financial support.",,2011

Solubilization of fenretinide in simulated saliva (SS) was studied by incorporating nonionic surfactants (Tween® 20 and 80, and Brij® 35 and 98), bile salts (sodium salt of cholic, taurocholic, glycocholic, and deoxycholic acids), phospholipid (lecithin), and novel polymeric solubilizer (Souplus®). Adhesive (polycarbophil: hydroxypropyl methylcellulose 4KM) and drug release (Fenretinide/Eudragit® RL PO with or without solubilizers) layers were prepared by solvent casting. Oral mucoadhesive patches were formed by attaching drug and adhesive layers onto backing layer (Tegaderm™ film). Physical state of drug in Eudragit® films was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Evaluation of   and   fenretinide release from the patch was conducted in SS containing 5%w/v sodium deoxycholate and rabbits, respectively. Fenretinide was quantified by HPLC. Tween® 20 and 80, Brij® 98, and sodium deoxycholate exhibited the highest fenretinide solubilization potential among the solubilizers. Drug loading efficiency in Eudragit® films was 90%–97%. XRD suggested fenretinide was amorphous in solubilizer-free and solubilizer-loaded films. Solubilizer-free patch exhibited poor   and   controlled drug release behavior. Increases in drug loading (5–10 wt%) or changes in polymeric matrix permeability did not provide continuous drug release. Co-incorporation of either single or mixed solubilizers in fenretinide/Eudragit® patches, (20 wt% Tween® 20, Tween® 80 and sodium deoxycholate or 20 wt% Tween® 80 + 40 wt% sodium deoxycholate solubilizers) led to significantly improved continuous   fenretinide release.

566,,,[],"Protein therapy is considered an alternative approach to gene therapy for treatment of genetic-metabolic disorders. Human protein therapeutics (PTs), developed via recombinant DNA technology and used for the treatment of these illnesses, act upon membrane-bound receptors to achieve their pharmacological response. On the contrary, proteins that normally act inside the cells cannot be developed as PTs in the conventional way, since they are not able to “cross” the plasma membrane. Furthermore, in mitochondrial disorders, attributed either to depleted or malfunctioned mitochondrial proteins, PTs should also have to reach the subcellular mitochondria to exert their therapeutic potential. Nowadays, there is no effective therapy for mitochondrial disorders. The development of PTs, however, via the Protein Transduction Domain (PTD) technology offered new opportunities for the deliberate delivery of human recombinant proteins inside eukaryotic subcellular organelles. To this end, mitochondrial disorders could be clinically encountered with the delivery of human mitochondrial proteins (engineered via recombinant DNA and PTD technologies) at specific intramitochondrial sites to exert their function. Overall, PTD-mediated Protein Replacement Therapy emerges as a suitable model system for the therapeutic approach for mitochondrial disorders.","amino acids coding sequence central nervous system Cytochrome   Oxidase

The development of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) has been useful; however, many CPPs are found trapped within endosomes, limiting their use as delivery agents. We optimize a class of CPPs, cationic amphiphilic polyproline helices (CAPHs), for direct transport into cells with mitochondrial localization through dimerization. The CAPH P11LRR used for this study has been found to enter cells by two distinct pathways: an endocytotic pathway was favored at low concentrations; internalization by direct transport was observed at higher concentrations. CAPH was dimerized to probe if direct transport within cells may be enhanced through increased association of CAPH with the membrane and through the association of individual peptides within the membrane. The dimerization of the CAPH was found to significantly increase cellular uptake over its monomeric counterpart, with a concomitant lowering of the concentration threshold favoring direct transport. Evidence for direct transport within cells and mitochondrial localization was observed. CAPH cellular uptake efficiency can be significantly enhanced through peptide dimerization while favoring cell entry via direct transport at low concentration with low cell toxicity.","cationic amphiphilic polyproline helix cell-penetrating peptide fetal bovine serum carbonylcyanide p-trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone fluorescein 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl N,N,N',N'-Tetramethyl- -(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)uranium hexafluorophosphate 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester phosphate-buffered saline",,,2011

These compounds, SkQBerb and SkQPalm, were tested in model planar phospholipid membranes and micelles, liposomes, isolated mitochondria and living cells. SkQBerb and SkQPalm penetrated across planar bilayer phospholipid membrane in their cationic forms and accumulated in mitochondria isolated or in living human cells in culture. Reduced forms of SkQBerb and SkQPalm as well as C10Berb and C10Palm (SkQBerb and SkQPalm analogs lacking plastoquinol moiety) revealed radical scavenging activity in lipid micelles and liposomes, while oxidized forms were inactive. In isolated mitochondria and in living cells, berberine and palmatine moieties were not reduced, so antioxidant activity of C10Berb and C10Palm was not detected. SkQBerb and SkQPalm inhibited lipid peroxidation in isolated mitochondria at nanomolar concentrations; their prooxidant effect was observed at 1,000 times higher concentrations.

Cerebral microdialysis and intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring were performed in Sprague–Dawley rats treated by intraperitoneal injection of either dimethylsulfoxide (vehicle) or Ro5-4864 following cortical contusion and further correlated with quantitative assessment of mitochondrial damage, water content in the injured tissue, modified neurological severity score, and lesion size. Ro5-4864 resulted in a profound decrease in ICP that correlated with improved cerebral metabolism characterized by significantly higher glucose and pyruvate and lower lactate concentrations in the pericontusional area in comparison with vehicle-treated animals. Reduced ICP correlated with reduced water content in the injured tissue; improved metabolism was associated with reduced mitochondrial damage evidenced by electron microscopy. Both effects were associated with a profound and significant reduction in glycerol release and lesion size, and correlated with improved neurological recovery.

Furosemide was ground at liquid nitrogen temperature for 30, 60, 120 and 180 min. Mixtures of furosemide-PVP and furosemide-inulin (1:1) were milled under cryogenic conditions. Materials were analyzed by XRD, UPLC, MS and NMR. Upon increasing the milling time, a significant build-up of an unidentified impurity 1, probably the main degradation product, was noticed. Cogrinding of furosemide with PVP and inulin worsened chemical stabilization of the pharmaceutical. The main degradation product formed upon cryomilling was subsequently identified as 4-chloro-5-sulfamoylanthranilic acid (CSA). Based on some theoretical considerations involving specific milling conditions, the milling intensity and an expected specific milling dose have been calculated. Results indicate that cryogenic grinding is capable to initiate mechanically induced decomposition of furosemide. Cryogenic grinding can activate and accelerate not only structural changes (solid state amorphization) but also chemical decomposition of pharmaceuticals.

576,,,[],"To relate NMR relaxation times to instability-related molecular motions of freeze-dried protein formulations and to examine the effect of sugars on these motions. Rotating-frame spin-lattice relaxation time (T ) was determined for both protein and sugar carbons in freeze-dried lysozyme-sugar (trehalose, sucrose and isomaltose) formulations using solid-state  C NMR. The temperature dependence of T  for the lysozyme carbonyl carbons in lysozyme with and without sugars was describable with a model that includes two different types of molecular motion with different correlation times (τ ) for the carbon with each τ  showing Arrhenius temperature dependence. Both relaxation modes have much smaller relaxation time constant (τ ) and temperature coefficient (Ea) than structural relaxation and may be classified as β-relaxation and γ-relaxation. The τ  and Ea for γ-relaxation were not affected by sugars, but those for β-relaxation were increased by sucrose, changed little by trehalose, and decreased by isomaltose, suggesting that the β-mobility of the lysozyme carbonyl carbons is decreased by sucrose and increased by isomaltose. T  determined for the lysozyme carbonyl carbons can reflect the effect of sugars on molecular mobility in lysozyme.

Phase nature of acetaminophen powders was identified using powder X-ray diffractometry, SEM, and thermal analysis. Powder tabletability was evaluated on a compaction simulator. Mechanical properties of acetaminophen and HPC were determined by nanoindentation. Spray-drying successfully produced acetaminophen particles enveloped with a layer of HPC but did not cause any detectable phase change of acetaminophen. At 200 MPa, physical mixtures containing up to 40% HPC could not be compressed into intact tablets. In contrast, acetaminophen coated with 1% to 10% HPC could form strong tablets (tensile strength was 1.9–7.0 MPa) at 200 MPa. Under a given compaction pressure, tablet tensile strength increased sharply with the amount of HPC coating. The profoundly improved tabletability of acetaminophen confirmed the effectiveness of the particle coating approach in improving tableting performance of drugs. HPC coating by spray-drying profoundly enhances tabletability of acetaminophen.

We performed evaluation of the binding of excipient to GLP-1, the DPP IV sensitivity of GLP-1 formulated with PGC as the excipient, the   bio-activity of excipient-formulated GLP-1, the   pharmacokinetics of excipient-formulated GLP-1, and the efficacy of the excipient-formulated GLP-1 in diabetic rats. We showed reproducible synthesis of PGC excipient, high affinity binding of PGC to GLP-1, slowed protease degradation of excipient-formulated GLP-1, and that excipient-formulated GLP-1 induced calcium influx in INS cells. Excipient-formulated GLP-1 stays in the blood for at least 4 days. When excipient-formulated GLP-1 was given subcutaneously once a week to diabetic ZDF rats, a significant reduction of HbA1c compared to control was observed. The reduction is similar to diabetic ZDF rats given exendin twice a day.

584,,,[],"To explore the use of crystal inter-planar d-spacings and slip-plane interaction energies for predicting and characterising mechanical properties of crystalline solids. Potential relationships were evaluated between mechanical properties and inter-planar d-spacing, inter-planar interaction energy, and dispersive surface energy as determined using inverse gas chromatography (IGC) for a set of pharmaceutical materials. Inter-planar interaction energies were determined by molecular modelling. General trends were observed between mechanical properties and the largest inter-planar d-spacing, inter-planar interaction energies, and IGC dispersive surface energy. A number of materials showed significant deviations from general trends. Weak correlations and outliers were rationalised. Results suggest that the highest d-spacing of a material could serve as a first-order indicator for ranking mechanical behaviour of pharmaceutical powders, but with some reservation. Inter-planar interaction energy normalised for surface area shows only a weak link with mechanical properties and does not appear to capture essential physics of deformation. A novel framework linking mechanical properties of crystals to the distinct quantities, slip-plane energy barrier and inter-planar interaction (detachment) energy is proposed.",,,,2012

Breakdown of sCT by trypsin, chymotrypsin and neutrophil elastase was investigated. The presence of enzymes in cell supernatant and homogenate was studied by immunoblot and enzyme activity by model substrate assay. Transport studies across Calu-3 monolayers were performed. sCT concentration remained unchanged over 2 h, when incubated in supernatant or with cell monolayers, independent of cell type studied. When cell homogenates were used, sCT concentrations were reduced to varying extents. sCT was degraded when incubated with enzymes alone. Western blot revealed abundance of all proteinases in cell homogenates and weaker expression in supernatants. Transport studies indicated net-absorptive sCT translocation; presence of bacitracin resulted in increased amount of sCT in receiver compartments.

This work was a natural extension to the companion article  . The drug release model governed the amount of substance released in distinct GI regions over time. GI distribution of released drug substance, region specific rate and extent of absorption and the influence of food intake were estimated. The model was informed by magnetic marker monitoring data and data from an intubation study with local administration in colon. Distinctly different absorption properties were characterized for different GI regions. Bioavailability over the gut-wall was estimated to be high in duodenum (70%) compared to the small intestine (25%). Colon was primarily characterized by a very slow rate of absorption.

Manufacturers are expected to characterize and control sub-visible protein particles in their products due to their potential immunogenicity. Light obscuration, the most commonly used analytical tool to count microscopic particles, does not allow discrimination between potentially harmful protein aggregates and harmless pharmaceutical components, e.g. silicone oil, commonly present in drug products. Microscopic image analysis in flow-microscopy techniques allows not only counting, but also classification of sub-visible particles based on morphology. We present a novel approach to define software filters for analysis of particle morphology in flow-microscopic images enhancing the capabilities of flow-microscopy. Image morphology analysis was applied to analyze flow-microscopy data from experimental test sets of protein aggregates and silicone oil suspensions. A combination of four image morphology parameters was found to provide a reliable basis for automatic distinction between silicone oil droplets and protein aggregates in protein biopharmaceuticals resulting in low misclassification errors.

Based on the classic singular perturbation theory by selecting appropriate scales of time, we derive requirements with which the Michaelis-Menten and Qss models are suitable approximations. Under the Qss assumption we show that other simplifications of the general TMD model can be similarly obtained as the Michaelis-Menten and Qss models. We compare these models by simulations using known application examples. The Michaelis-Menten and Qss models are direct simplifications of the general TMD model and, moreover, suitable approximations if certain specific requirements on the parameters are met. As a first attempt to quantify the closeness of some simplifications to the general TMD model, our work should provide a more rigorous basis for the theoretical and practical research of TMD models, which are important for investigating the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of many biological compounds.",,"I thank Ms. Florence Hourcade-Potelleret for helpful discussions, and I also thank the reviewers for insightful comments.",,2012

612,,,[],"A novel and effective treatment is urgently needed to deal with the current treatment dilemma in incurable differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC) and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC). Reversine, a small synthetic purine analogue (2,6-disubstituted purine), has been shown to be effective in tumor suppression. We performed   evaluation of anti-tumor effects of reversine on proliferation, cell cycle, and apoptosis in human PDTC, ATC, and follicular thyroid cancer cell lines, respectively. Treatment of these three lines with reversine inhibited proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner. G2/M accumulation was demonstrated in cell cycle analysis. Reversine induced apoptosis in PDTC cells with caspase-3 and caspase-8 activation, but not caspase-9. Use of a pan-caspase inhibitor before treatment with reversine attenuated cell death. Reversine also showed   growth inhibitory effects on ATC cells in a xenograft nude mice model. Data demonstrated that reversine is effective in inhibiting the growth of thyroid cancer cells by cell cycle arrest or apoptosis, especially with the more aggressive ATC and PDTC. Apoptosis was induced by the mitochondria-independent pathway.

We aimed to clarify the mechanism of dFdC resistance in a pancreatic cancer cell line by applying a combination of targeted proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Twenty-five enzyme and transporter proteins and 6 metabolites were quantified in sensitive and resistant pancreatic cancer cell lines, PK9 and RPK9, respectively. The protein concentration of deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) in RPK9 cells was less than 0.02-fold (2 %) compared with that in PK9 cells, whereas the differences (fold) were within a factor of 3 for other proteins. Targeted metabolomic analysis revealed that phosphorylated forms of dFdC were reduced to less than 0.2 % in RPK9 cells. The extracellular concentration of 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine (dFdU), an inactive metabolite of dFdC, reached the same level as the initial dFdC concentration in RPK9 cells. However, tetrahydrouridine treatment did not increase phosphorylated forms of dFdC and did not reverse dFdC resistance in RPK9 cells, though this treatment inhibits production of dFdU. Combining targeted proteomics and metabolomics suggests that acquisition of resistance in RPK9 cells is due to attenuation of dFdC phosphorylation via suppression of dCK.","ATP binding cassette breast cancer resistance protein cytidine deaminase concentrative nucleoside transporter cytidine 5′-triphosphate synthetase deoxycytidine kinase deoxycytidylate deaminase 2′,2′-difluorodeoxycytidine or gemcitabine gemcitabine diphosphate gemcitabine monophosphate gemcitabine triphosphate 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine 2′,2′-difluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate equilibrative nucleoside transporter 9-beta-D-arabinofuranosyl-2-fluoroadenine monophosphate liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer multidrug resistance protein 1 multiple reaction monitoring multidrug resistance-associated proteins cytosolic 5′-nucleotidase ribonucleotide reductase subunit 1 ribonucleotide reductase subunit 2 tetrahydrouridine","We thank K.

The improved skin rejuvenation effects, such as depigmentation and anti-wrinkle effects, by enhanced topical delivery of α-bisabolol and epidermal growth factor (EGF) through the RF microchannels were investigated in photo-damaged skin. The cumulative amounts of active ingredients through the RF microporated skin were significantly increased. Topically applied α-bisabolol after RF microporation induced rapid onset of skin whitening and significantly increased the ΔL-value of UVB-induced hyperpigmented melanin hairless mouse skin. In addition, wrinkle formation after topical application of EGF with RF microporation was significantly reduced and prevented after 12 weeks, and all parameters involving wrinkles in a replica analysis were similar to those in the negative control. RF microporation enhances the topical delivery of active ingredients with high molecular weight or of small hydrophilic or lipophilic molecules.

Insulin was exposed for 3 h at room temperature to the oxidative system copper(II)/ascorbate. Chemical derivatization with 4-(aminomethyl) benzenesulfonic acid (ABS) was performed to detect 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) formation. Electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) was employed to localize the amino acids targeted by oxidation and the cross-links involved in insulin aggregation. Oxidation at different pH and temperature was monitored with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and ESI-MS analysis to further investigate the chemical mechanism(s), to estimate the aggregates content and to quantify DOPA in aggregated insulin. The results implicate the formation of DOPA and 2-amino-3-(3,4-dioxocyclohexa-1,5-dien-1-yl) propanoic acid (DOCH), followed by Michael addition, as responsible for new cross-links resulting in covalent aggregation of insulin during MCO.

Seventeen subjects were classified into three CYP2C19 groups based on their genotypes: homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs;   = 5), heterozygous EMs (htEMs;   = 7) and poor metabolizers (PMs;   = 5). After single IV administration of racemic omeprazole (20 mg), the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC ) of  (+)-omeprazole in PMs was significantly higher than that in hmEMs and htEMs, while that of  (−)-omeprazole was no significance among three genotypes because of a wide inter-individual variability. In addition, although the AUC  of  (+)-5-hydroxyomeprazole were determined among three genotypes, the that of  (−)-5-hydroxyomeprazole was undetectable in the hmEMs and barely detectable in the htEMs. Conversly, the AUC  of  (−)-5-hydroxyomeprazole was greater than that of  (+)-5-hydroxyomeprazole in the PMs. These data therefore suggest that, for EMs, the CYP2C19-mediated formation from  (+)-enantiomer is a 5-hydroxy-metabolite, while that from  (−)-enantiomer may be a minor metabolite. Thus, the   disposition of  (−)- and  (+)-omeprazole after racemic dosing may be different among the CYP2C19 genotypes.",area under the plasma concentration-time curve maximum plasma concentration cytochrome P450 homozygous extensive metabolizers high-performance liquid chromatography heterozygous extensive metabolizers intravenous elimination rate constant poor metabolizers oral administration proton pump inhibitor elimination half-life,"This works was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (no. 20590150) Tokyo, Japan.",,2012

621,,,[],"Development of the first   method based on biosensor chip technology designed for probing the interfacial interaction phenomena between transmembrane ocular mucins and adhesive polymers and dendrimers intended for ophthalmic administration. The surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technique was used. A transmembrane ocular mucin surface was prepared on the chip surface and characterized by QCM-D (Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation) and XPS (X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy). The mucoadhesive molecules tested were: hyaluronic acid (HA), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC), chitosan (Ch) and polyamidoamine dendrimers (PAMAM). While Ch originated interfacial interaction with ocular transmembrane mucins, for HA, CMC and HPMC, chain interdiffusion seemed to be mandatory for bioadherence at the concentrations used in ophthalmic clinical practise. Interestingly, PAMAM dendrimers developed permanent interfacial interactions with transmembrane ocular mucins whatever their surface chemical groups, showing a relevant importance of co-operative effect of these multivalent systems. Polymers developed interfacial interactions with ocular membrane-associated mucins in the following order: Ch(1 %) > G4PAMAM-NH (2 %) = G4PAMAM-OH(2 %) > G3.5PAMAM-COOH(2 %)>> CMC(0.5 %) = HA(0.2 %) = HPMC(0.3 %).

Single (gp100) and multiple (B16-tumor lysate containing gp100) antigens were encapsulated within differing molecular weight PLGA co-polymers. Differences in morphology, encapsulation/release and biologic potency were studied. Findings were adopted to encapsulate fresh tumor lysate from patients with advanced tumors and compare stimulation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) against that achieved by soluble lysate. Four cycles of freeze-thaw + 15 s sonication resulted in antigen-rich lysates without the need for toxic detergents or protease inhibitors. The 80KDa polymer resulted in maximal release of payload and favorable production of immunostimulatory IL-2 and IFN-γ.

The ability of SIOS and DLS to resolve bimodal samples was evaluated by measuring a mixture of 217 and 355 nm standard nanoparticles. Opsonization of liposomes by plasma was also studied using SIOS. SIOS was shown to measure the size of different liposomes with higher sensitivity than DLS and it requires a smaller sample volume than DLS. With appropriate calibration, SIOS could be used to determine particle number concentrations. In comparison, SIOS analysis of the mixture showed accurate resolution of the population as a bimodal distribution over a wide range of number ratios of the particles.

De-agglomeration profiles of Lactohale 300  (L300) and micronized lactose (ML) were constructed by particle sizing aerosolised plumes dispersed at air flow rates of 30–180 l/min. The work of cohesion distribution was determined by inverse gas chromatography. The primary particle size and tapped density distributions were determined. Powder strength distributions were calculated by Monte Carlo simulations from distributions of particle size, work of cohesion and tapped density measurements. The powder strength distribution of L300 was broader than that of ML. Up to 85th percentile, powder strength of L300 was lower than ML which was consistent with the better de-agglomeration of L300 at low flow rates. However, ~15% of L300 particles had higher powder strength than ML which likely to cause lower de-agglomeration for L300 at high air flow rates.

Single IV doses of 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mg/kg and a single SC injection of 20 mg/kg of anti-BR3 antibody was administered to mice. Serum drug and BAFF concentrations and splenic B-cell concentrations were measured at various time points.

Fractional receptor occupancy served as the driving function for a competitive reversible antagonism model to characterize B-cell dynamics. Noncompartmental analysis revealed a decrease in drug clearance (31.3 to 7.93 mL/day/kg) with increasing IV doses. The SC dose exhibited slow absorption (T  = 2 days) and complete bioavailability. All doses resulted in a dose-dependent increase in BAFF concentrations and decrease in B-cell counts.

After incubation of the aglycone with the cells, a steady-state ( , zero-order or near zero-order) excretion of its glucuronide is rapidly achieved and then maintained. Kinetic profiling with different (intracellular) glucuronide concentrations and their corresponding excretion rates is enabled by varying the concentration of the aglycone, which allows for the determination of kinetic parameters responsible for BCRP-mediated efflux of glucuronides. This approach was validated theoretically using a cellular pharmacokinetic model incorporating various enzymatic and transporter-mediated kinetic processes. It was also validated experimentally in that kinetic parameters of efflux of glucuronides of 6-hydroxyflavone and 4-methylumberiferone in the HeLa1A9 cell model were shown to be consistent with those derived with BCRP-overexpressing membrane vesicles.

The depth, uniformity and pathways of penetration of both markers into human nail during passive and iontophoretic experiments were investigated. The penetration of sodium fluorescein into the dorsal, ventral and intermediate layers of the nail was also studied. Transversal images were used to estimate directly the relative penetration of the markers with respect to the complete thickness of the nail. “Exposed layer” images allowed estimating the depth of penetration by taking xy-plans, starting by the exposed layer, and following the z axis into the nail. The fluorescent markers penetrated 7–12% of the nail thickness. Iontophoresis increased penetration of both markers compared to passive diffusion. However, ungual penetration was not modified by the intensity of current applied. Penetration into the dorsal, ventral, and intermediate nail layers was similar. The method developed allowed inter- and intra- nail variability to be accounted for. Iontophoresis enhanced moderately the penetration of the two markers into the nail plate as compared to passive diffusion.

IL-1Ra loaded PF127 gels showed   sustained release of IL-1Ra, depending on the concentration of gel used. SDS-PAGE confirmed the stability of protein during its   release. PF127 gel also exhibited prolonged release of IL-1Ra in rats as compared to that of IL-1Ra aq. solution.   bioactivity of IL-1Ra loaded in gel was confirmed by its ability to inhibit IL-1β-stimulated induction of IL-6.

The performance of the currently used monitoring protocol as defined in the summary of product characteristics (SPC) is however unknown. The objective of this analysis was to develop a model-based framework for evaluation and optimization of cardiac monitoring strategies. The model-based framework comprised a previously developed exposure-response model for trastuzumab induced changes in LVEF, and a protocol-execution model that allowed incorporation of treatment interventions as described by a monitoring protocol. Metrics for evaluation of toxicity, dose intensity and monitoring burden were defined to allow evaluation and optimization of cardiac monitoring protocols. The success of a protocol-defined dose reduction was improved from 40% for the SPC-based protocol, to 79% for a scoring-based protocol, thereby decreasing the observed severity of cardiotoxicity. Including adaptation based on risk-profile allowed reduction of the mean number of LVEF measurements by 19%. This model-based evaluation approach enabled evaluation and optimization of cardiac monitoring protocols that would be difficult to evaluate in a clinical setting. This approach can potentially be applied for other drugs that use repeated evaluation of continuous biomarkers for toxicity.","area below a LVEF threshold of 45% and above the LVEF time curve full-treatment AUC

Experiments were performed in side-by-side diffusion cells with human epidermal membrane (HEM)   to determine the effect of donor solution pH upon the permeation of the β-blockers across HEM. The apparent permeability coefficients of HEM for the β-blockers increased with their lipophilicity, suggesting the HEM lipoidal pathway as the main permeation mechanism of the β-blockers. The pH in the donor solution was a major factor influencing HEM permeation for the β-blockers with a 2- to 4-fold increase in the permeability coefficient per pH unit increase. This permeability   pH relationship was found to deviate from theoretical predictions, possibly due to the effective stratum corneum pH being different from the pH in the donor solution.

The recovery of micropores was investigated   by measuring Transepidermal water loss (TEWL) at different time points. The passive, microneedle and iontophoresis mediated delivery did not lead to significant improvement in hematological and biochemical parameters in anemic rats, when used individually. When iontophoresis (0.15 mA/cm  for 4 hours) was combined with microneedle pretreatment (for 2 min), therapeutically adequate amount of FPP was delivered and there was significant recovery of rats from IDA.

Anionic formulations with anionic lipid/Ca /siRNA ratio of 1.3/2.5/1 (AF1) and 1.3/0.3/1 (AF2) were utilized. Uptake mechanisms were investigated using uptake inhibition and co-localization approaches in breast cancer cells. Actin-mediated uptake was investigated using actin polymerization and rearrangement assays. Silencing efficiency and endosomal escaping capability of lipoplexes were evaluated. The cationic formulation Lipofectamine-2000 was used as a control. Anionic lipoplexes entered the breast cancer cells   endocytosis specifically   macropinocytosis or   both macropinocytosis and HSPG (heparin sulfate proteoglycans) pathways, depending on the Ca /siRNA ratio. Additionally, uptake of these lipoplexes was both microtubule and actin dependent. The control cationic lipid-siRNA complexes (Lipofectamine-2000) were internalized   both endocytic (phagocytosis, HSPG) and non-endocytic (membrane fusion) pathways. Their uptake was microtubule independent but actin dependent. Silencing efficiency of the AF2 formulation was negligible mainly due to poor endosomal release (rate-limiting step). Formulation composition significantly influences the internalization mechanism of anionic lipoplexes. Uptake mechanism together with formulation bioactivity helped in identification of the rate-limiting steps to efficient siRNA delivery.

An   3D dimer model is developed to identify the bevacizumab-bevacizumab interface, and different corticosteroids are docked onto the model to distinguish preferred binding sites.   predictions are validated by   stability studies, where the antibody is stressed in presence or absence of each corticosteroid and formed aggregates are quantified by asymmetrical flow field-flow fractionation. The dimer model features one close crystal contact area: Lys445 on the Fc region interacts with one Fab arm of the second bevacizumab. Docking reveals an interaction between the phosphate group of dexamethasone phosphate and Lys445, while the rest of the molecule is hindering dimer formation. Predictions are confirmed  , demonstrating that dexamethasone phosphate and betamethasone phosphate partly prevent antibody aggregation, whereas triamcinolone acetonide phosphate does not. Results suggest that bevacizumab monomers follow a specific mechanism to form dimers in which a protein-protein interaction hotspot can be distinguished.

666,,,[],"Quantitative prediction of complex drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is challenging. Repaglinide is mainly metabolized by cytochrome-P-450 (CYP)2C8 and CYP3A4, and is also a substrate of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1. The purpose is to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model to predict the pharmacokinetics and DDIs of repaglinide. 
                    hepatic transport of repaglinide, gemfibrozil and gemfibrozil 1- -β-glucuronide was characterized using sandwich-culture human hepatocytes. A PBPK model, implemented in Simcyp (Sheffield, UK), was developed utilizing   transport and metabolic clearance data. 
                    studies suggested significant active hepatic uptake of repaglinide. Mechanistic model adequately described repaglinide pharmacokinetics, and successfully predicted DDIs with several OATP1B1 and CYP3A4 inhibitors (<10% error). Furthermore, repaglinide-gemfibrozil interaction at therapeutic dose was closely predicted using   fraction metabolism for CYP2C8 (0.71), when primarily considering reversible inhibition of OATP1B1 and mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C8 by gemfibrozil and gemfibrozil 1- -β-glucuronide. This study demonstrated that hepatic uptake is rate-determining in the systemic clearance of repaglinide. The model quantitatively predicted several repaglinide DDIs, including the complex interactions with gemfibrozil. Both OATP1B1 and CYP2C8 inhibition contribute significantly to repaglinide-gemfibrozil interaction, and need to be considered for quantitative rationalization of DDIs with either drug.",,The authors would like to thank Drs.

Because data are limited in human subjects, particularly for new drugs, experimental animal models of lactational drug transfer are critical. This study analyzed drug transfer into milk in a mouse model, as well as the contribution of similar and dissimilar host factors. Milk/plasma drug concentration ratios (M/P) in humans were obtained from the literature, while those in mice were determined experimentally after intraperitoneal implantation of osmotic pumps containing drugs of interest. Unbound drug fractions in plasma and milk were determined   for both species. M/P values were determined for 27 drugs in mice and compared with those in human. These values were increased in mice for 21 drugs; the geometric mean ratio of M/P between mice and humans was 2.03 (95% CI, 1.42–2.89) for all 27 drugs. These results were reasonably explained by the relatively high protein and lipid content in mouse milk. Moreover, species-specific asymmetrical transport systems were suggested for 9 drugs.

B16F10 experimental metastasis model using C57BL/6 mice injected with Taxotere® containing 10% 7-epimer showed higher weight loss as compared to Taxotere® containing no epimer at single dose of 40 mg/kg indicating higher systemic toxicity. Incubation of PEGylated liposomes with phosphate buffer saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% w/v Tween-80 for 48 h showed better resistance to docetaxel degradation when compared with Taxotere® injection indicating better   stability of liposomal docetaxel. In addition, PEGylated liposomes showed enhanced   cytotoxicity, against A549 and B16F10 cells, than Taxotere®.

A higher level of AE precipitation was observed for formulations containing Cremophor EL (~30%) compared to formulations containing Tween 80 (~10%) after lipolysis. However, rapid re-dissolution of the precipitated AE from LBDDS containing Cremophor EL in the intestinal biorelevant media was observed. The transport of AE loaded in LBDDS was enhanced in comparison to that of free drug due to the increased AE solubility. The apparent permeability of all AE-LBDDS across Caco-2 cell monolayers was approximately 3.10  cm/s. A decrease in the permeability was observed at 4°C. M cells did not influence the transport of AE-LBDDS, and mucus decreased AE permeability when formulated with Tween 80. Furthermore, AE is not a P-glycoprotein substrate.

Lymph or blood samples were taken and halofantrine, triglyceride, phospholipid and  C-lipid concentrations measured. Lymphatic lipid transport increased linearly with lipid dose, was similar across species and in male/female animals. In contrast, lymphatic transport of halofantrine differed markedly across species (dogs>rats>mice) and plateaued at higher lipid doses. Lower bioavailability appeared responsible for some species differences in halofantrine lymphatic transport; however other systematic differences were involved. A contemporary lymph-cannulated mouse model was established which will enable investigation of lymphatic transport in transgenic and disease models.

683,,,[],"The lymphatic system plays crucial roles in tissue fluid balance, trafficking of immune cells, and the uptake of dietary lipid from the intestine. Given these roles there has been an interest in targeting lymphatics through oral lipid-based formulations or intradermal delivery of drug carrier systems. However the mechanisms regulating lipid uptake by lymphatics remain unknown. Thus we sought to modify a previously developed   model to investigate the role of ATP in lipid uptake into the lymphatics. Lymphatic endothelial cells were cultured on a transwell membrane and the effective permeability to free fatty acid and Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid was calculated in the presence or absence of the ATP inhibitor sodium azide. ATP inhibition reduced Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid transport, but not dextran transport. FFA transport was ATP-dependent primarily during early periods of ATP inhibition, while Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid transport was lowered at all time points studied. Furthermore, the transcellular component of transport was highly ATP-dependent, a mechanism not observed in fibroblasts, suggesting these mechanisms are unique to lymphatics. Total transport of Caco-2 cell-secreted lipid was dose-dependently reduced by ATP inhibition, and transcellular lipoprotein transport was completely attenuated. The transport of lipid across the lymphatic endothelium as demonstrated with this   model occurs in part by an ATP-dependent, transcellular route independent of passive permeability. It remains to be determined the extent that this mechanism exists   and future work should be directed in this area.",,This work is supported by the NIH grant R00 HL091133.

The effect of β-galactosidase-expressing AnExILs on maturation and particle uptake by murine DC cell line, fresh human monocyte-derived DCs or human dermal DCs in skin explants was investigated and compared to the effects of either plain liposomes or IVTT mix alone. AnExILs induced efficient DC chemotaxis and promoted up-regulation of maturation markers on murine DCs, due to the presence of IVTT in the formulation. Furthermore, the amount of active βGal associated with DCs was higher for AnExILs than for free βGal expressed in IVTT or βGal encapsulated into non-adjuvanted liposomes. Most interestingly, the same trend was observed with human DCs. Both IVTT mix and liposomal vehicles were shown to be key components of the AnExIL formulation responsible for its adjuvanticity.

However, some drawbacks have been reported in the use of silicone. Therefore, ethylene vinyl acetate copolymer (EVA) was tested in order to replace it. EVA rings were produced by a hot-melt extrusion procedure. Swelling and degradation assays of these matrices were conducted in different mixtures of ethanol/water. Solubility and partition coefficient of progesterone were measured, together with the initial hormone load and characteristic dimensions. A mathematical model was used to design an EVA ring that releases the hormone at specific rate. An EVA ring releasing progesterone   at about 12.05 ± 8.91 mg day  was successfully designed. This rate of release is similar to that observed for Progering®. In addition, it was observed that as the initial hormone load or ring dimension increases, the rate of release also increases. Also, the device lifetime was extended with a rise in the initial amount of hormone load. EVA rings could be designed to release progesterone   at a rate of 12.05 ± 8.91 mg day . This ring would be used in contraception therapies during lactation. The use of EVA in this field could have initially several advantages: less initial and residual hormone content in rings, no need for additional steps of curing or crosslinking, less manufacturing time and costs, and the possibility to recycle the used rings.",,"The authors wish to express their gratitude to Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas (CONICET), and to Universidad Nacional del Litoral (UNL) of Argentina, for the financial support granted to this contribution.",,2014

This may restrict the penetration of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) into the brain. However, the mechanisms underlying increased Pgp expression in epilepsy patients are not known. One possibility is that AEDs induce the expression and functionality of Pgp in BCECs. Several older AEDs that induce human cytochrome P450 enzymes also induce Pgp in hepatocytes and enterocytes, but whether this extends to Pgp at the human BBB and to newer AEDs is not known. This prompted us to study the effects of various old and new AEDs on Pgp functionality in the human BCEC line, hCMEC/D3, using the rhodamine 123 (Rho123) efflux assay. For comparison, experiments were performed in two rat BCEC lines, RBE4 and GPNT, and primary cultures of rat and pig BCECs. Furthermore, known Pgp inducers, such as dexamethasone and several cytostatic drugs, were included in our experiments. Under control conditions, GPNT cells exhibited the highest and RBE4 the lowest Pgp expression and Rho123 efflux, while intermediate values were determined in hCMEC/D3. Known Pgp inducers increased Rho123 efflux in all cell lines, but marked inter-cell line differences in effect size were observed. Of the various AEDs examined, only carbamazepine (100 μM) moderately increased Pgp functionality in hCMEC/D3, while valproate (300 μM) inhibited Pgp.

We have examined the potential for one of these pathways, cell adhesion molecule (CAM)-mediated endocytosis induced by targeting intercellular adhesion molecule -1 (ICAM-1), to transport drug carriers into and across BBB models. Model polymer nanocarriers (NCs) coated with control IgG or antibodies against ICAM-1 (IgG NCs  . anti-ICAM NCs; ~250-nm) were incubated with human brain ECs, astrocytes (ACs), or pericytes (PCs) grown as monocultures or bilayered (endothelial+subendothelial) co-cultures. ICAM-1 was present and overexpressed in disease-like conditions on ECs and, at a lesser extent, on ACs and PCs which are BBB subendothelial components. Specific targeting and CAM-mediated uptake of anti-ICAM NCs occurred in these cells, although this was greater for ECs. Anti-ICAM NCs were transported across endothelial monolayers and endothelial+subendothelial co-cultures modeling the BBB. CAM-mediated transport induced by ICAM-1 targeting operates in endothelial and subendothelial cellular components of the BBB, which may provide an avenue to overcome this barrier.",Human astrocytes Human brain microvascular endothelial cells 5-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride Fluorescein isothiocyanate Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 Immunoglobulin G Monodansylcadaverine Nanocarrier Human brain vascular pericytes,This work was supported by NIH grant R01-HL09816 (S.M.).,,2014

                   -(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer was tagged with a near infrared dye and used to detect the inflammation induced by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles in a murine peri-implant osteolysis model. It was established by inserting an implant into the distal femur and challenging with routine PMMA particles infusion. The osteolysis was evaluated by micro-CT and histological analysis at different time points. Significant peri-implant osteolysis was found 3-month post PMMA particle challenge by micro-CT and histological analysis. At 1-month post challenge, when there was no significant peri-implant bone loss, the HPMA copolymer-near infrared dye conjugate was found to specifically target the femur with PMMA particles deposition, but not the contralateral control femur with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) infusion. The results from this study demonstrate the feasibility of utilizing the macromolecular diagnostic agent to detect particle-induced peri-implant inflammation prior to the development of detectable osteolysis. Recognition of this early pathological event would provide the window of opportunity for prevention of peri-implant osteolysis and subsequent orthopaedic implant failure.","

Baseline diurnal IOP of normotensive albino rabbits, beagle dogs and patients with glaucoma or OHT was collected from literature. In addition, diurnal IOP of patients treated with brimonidine or Xalatan® were also obtained from literature. Healthy normotensive New Zealand rabbits were topically treated with a single drop of 0.15% brimonidine tartrate and normotensive beagle dogs were treated with a single drop of Xalatan®. At pre-determined time intervals, IOP was measured and aqueous humor samples were obtained from a satellite group of animals. Population based PKPD modeling was performed to describe the IOP data and the chosen model was extended to predict the IOP in patients. Baseline IOP clearly depicts a distinctive circadian rhythm in rabbits   human. An aqueous humor dynamics based physiological model was developed to describe the baseline diurnal IOP across species. Model was extended to incorporate the effect of drug administration on baseline IOP in rabbits and dogs. The translational model with substituted human aqueous humor dynamic parameters predicted IOP in patients following drug treatment.

In three different rat models [long-term anesthetized (with nasal surgery), short-term anesthetized (without nasal surgery) and conscious models], tacrine and loxapine were administered via nasal, intravenous and oral routes, and the plasma pharmacokinetics were compared among different models. Systemic exposures of both drugs and their metabolites were consistently higher in long-term anesthetized model after all routes of administration in comparison to that of conscious model. Nasal bioavailabilities in long-term anesthetized model (tacrine 83%, loxapine 97%) were much higher than that in conscious model (tacrine 10%, loxapine 46%). Further studies on tacrine and its metabolites demonstrated no significant difference in t  between short-term anesthetized and conscious models after all routes of administration; however, long-term anesthetized model showed significantly longer t .

Although widely used, the effect of formulation and process conditions on physicochemical and functional properties of enteric coatings remains unclear. Terahertz pulsed imaging (TPI) was employed to evaluate the coat properties of enteric coated tablets (ECTs) with various acid resistance. Other analytic methods, such as loss on drying, scanning electron microscopy and X-ray computed tomography were then used to validate the relationships established among 4 TPI-derived parameters and the physicochemical properties of enteric coatings. Weight gain measurement did not provide any information to assess acid resistance of enteric coating, whereas four TPI-derived parameters non-destructively reflected the coating properties such as thickness, coat uniformity, density, and water distribution, allowing the identification of the causes of poor acid resistance in certain ECT batches using a single measurement. These parameters also revealed the effect of coating conditions; in particular, coating under dry conditions led to less dense and nonuniform coatings with poor acid resistance.

A baseline IRT model characterizing the ADAS-cog was built based on data from 2,744 individuals. Pharmacometric methods were used to extend the baseline IRT model to describe longitudinal ADAS-cog scores from an 18-month clinical study with 322 patients. Sensitivity of the ADAS-cog items in different patient populations as well as the power to detect a drug effect in relation to total score based methods were assessed with the IRT based model. IRT analysis was able to describe both total and item level baseline ADAS-cog data. Longitudinal data were also well described. Differences in the information content of the item level components could be quantitatively characterized and ranked for mild cognitively impairment and mild AD populations. Based on clinical trial simulations with a theoretical drug effect, the IRT method demonstrated a significantly higher power to detect drug effect compared to the traditional method of analysis.

To determine that apoptosis is via the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, TMRE and caspase-9 assays were conducted. Finally, the involvement of p53/Bak specific pathway was tested. MTSs from Bak and Bax are capable of targeting p53 to the mitochondria, and p53-BakMTS and p53-BaxMTS cause apoptosis through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Additionally, p53-BakMTS, DBD-BakMTS, p53-BaxMTS and DBD-BaxMTS caused apoptosis in T47D, H1373, SKOV-3 and HeLa cells. The apoptotic mechanism of p53-BakMTS and DBD-BakMTS was Bak dependent. Our data demonstrates that p53-BakMTS (or BaxMTS) and DBD-BakMTS (or BaxMTS) cause apoptosis at the mitochondria and can be used as a potential gene therapeutic in cancer.","7-Aminoactinomycin D MTS from Bak MTS from Bax MTS from cytochrome c oxidase C-segment DNA binding domain Nuclear export signal MDM2 binding domain Murine double minute 2 Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization Mitochondrial targeting signal Nuclear localization signal MTS from ornithine transcarbamylase Pearson’s correlation coefficient Proline-rich domain Transactivation domain Tetramerization domain Transmembrane Tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester MTS from translocase of the outer membrane (TOM20) MTS from Bcl-XL","Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health under award number R01-CA151847.

In this work, Crizotinib an anti-tumoral drug approved for the treatment of non-small lung cancer in humans, and Sildenafil (Viagra ), were loaded into micellar carriers to evaluate the establishment of a possible synergistic anti-tumoral effect in breast cancer cells. Micellar carriers comprised by PEG-PLA block co-polymers were formulated by the solvent displacement method in which the simultaneous encapsulation of Crizotinib and Sildenafil was promoted. Encapsulation efficiency was analyzed by a new UPLC method validated for this combination of compounds. Micelle physicochemical characterization and cellular uptake were characterized by light scattering and confocal microscopy. The bio- and hemocompatibility of the carriers was also evaluated. MCF-7 breast cancer cells were used to investigate the synergistic anti-tumoral effect. Our results demonstrate that this particular combination induces massive apoptosis of breast cancer cells. The co-delivery of Crizotinib and Sildenafil was only possible due to the high encapsulation efficiency of the micellar systems (>70%). The micelles with size ranging between 93 and 127 nm were internalized by breast cancer cells and subsequently released their payload in the intracellular compartment. The results obtained demonstrated that the delivery of both drugs by micellar carriers led to a 2.7 fold increase in the anti-tumoral effect, when using only half of the concentration that is required when free drugs are administered. Altogether, co-delivery promoted a synergistic effect and demonstrated for the first time the potential of PEG-PLA-Crizotinib-Sildenafil combination for application in cancer therapy.",,"The authors would like to thank to Eng.

                    correlation (IVIVC) is a biopharmaceutical tool recommended for use in formulation development. When validated, IVIVC can be used to set dissolution limits and, based on the dissolution limits, as a surrogate for an   study. The purpose of this paper is to study the various methods used to fix dissolution limits. Fixing dissolution limits is not a straightforward process; various approaches exist. The classical ±10% of dissolution limits was compared to the recommended ±10% of Cmax and AUC and to an innovative back calculation of the 90% CI. Based on simulated values the influence of the calculation method as well as of the variability of the results and pharmacokinetic processes was investigated. Depending upon the method, the results are different and their comparison leads to possible rules. It appears that the usage of a back calculation of a 90% CI is an accurate and advantageous method when intra-individual variability associated with the drug is low. Those findings are in accordance with the current practice of IVIVC, which is not recommended for highly variable drugs. The approach of using a 90% CI allows the intra-subject variability to be taken into account and fixes limits that ensure a greater chance to show acceptable BE, in case of reasonable intra-subject variability, leading to setting broader   dissolution limits compared to classical solutions.",,,,2014

Transepithelial resistance and apparent permeability for paracellular flux markers was measured using Ussing-type chambers. Two-path impedance spectroscopy was employed to differentiate between transcellular and paracellular resistance, and confocal imaging and Western blotting was performed. Laurate resulted in a substantial and reversible decrease in transepithelial resistance by 50% which was attributed to a decrease in paracellular resistance. Simultaneously, an increase in permeability for fluorescein (330 Da) was detected, while permeabilities for 4 kDa FITC-dextran and sulpho-NHS-SS-biotin (607 Da) remained unaltered. Confocal laser-scanning microscopy revealed a marked reduction of claudin-5, while other tight junction proteins including tricellulin, a protein preventing the paracellular passage of macromolecules, were not affected. Laurate induces an increase in paracellular permeability for molecules up to a molecular mass of 330 Da by retrieval of claudin-5 from tight junctions without affecting tricellular contacts and the paracellular passage of macromolecules.

719,,,[],"The purpose of this study was to investigate the contribution of the dipole moment to overall protein-protein interactions and viscosity of a monoclonal antibody MAb1. The dipole moment of MAb1 was measured at various solution pH conditions using dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. The dipole moment for MAb1 was highest at pH 6.5, and the pH dependent change in molecular dipole correlated fairly well with previously observed trends of viscosity and storage modulus   pH. Moreover, the magnitude of the dielectric increment at pH 6.5 and 7.0 showed strong concentration dependence, indicating the presence of relatively strong dipole-dipole interactions at these pHs. To test if the cluster of charged residues present in the Fab contributes to the mean dipole moment observed for MAb1, additional mutants involving charge mutations in the CDR were investigated. In contrast to MAb1, all of the other MAbs showed significantly reduced pH and concentration dependence of the measured dipole moments and dielectric increments, respectively. The solution pH dependent measured dipole moments of MAb1 appears to be in line with the observed intermolecular interactions and viscosity behavior suggesting that dipole-dipole interaction plays an important role in governing the high concentration solution behavior of this MAb.",,"The authors thank Genentech Inc. for providing antibodies and financial support for this study, and Mariya Pindrus for repeating some of the experiments.",,2014

Pharmacokinetics (PK) and biodistribution of the radiolabeled IgG ( I-protein-01) in mice compared parameters from SIB and Iodogen protein iodination labeling methods. In addition, PK of radiolabeled 40 KDa protein ( I-protein-02) using SIB was compared with non-labeled protein-02 analyzed by ligand binding assay (LBA). Up to 72 h following a single IP injection to mice, the percentage of “free-label” determined by the soluble counts after TCA precipitation to total radioactivity in serum samples was 2.8–49.4%   <1.0% for  I-protein-01 iodinated   Iodogen or SIB methods, respectively, suggesting a higher   stability of  I-protein-01 labeled   the SIB method. The serum exposure of  I-protein-01 was two-fold higher, and correspondingly, the tissue exposure was also higher (averaging 3.6 fold at 168 h) when using SIB protein labeling method than when using the Iodogen method. In addition, following subcutaneous (SC) administration to mice, the serum exposure of  I-protein-02 labeled   SIB method was similar to protein-02 measure by LBA. In this study, iodination of proteins using SIB methodology has overcome the dehalogenation problem   which is inherent in Iodogen method, and PK parameters of a protein iodinated   SIB were comparable to the un-labeled protein measured by LBA.

Here we investigated the effect of annealing on local motions, both in amorphous sucrose and in the dispersions. The average relaxation time of the local motion (irrespective of origin) in sucrose, decreased upon annealing. However, the heterogeneity in relaxation time distribution as well as the dielectric strength decreased only for β - (the slower relaxation) but not for β -relaxations. The effect of annealing on β -relaxation times was neutralized by sorbitol while PVP negated the effect of annealing on both β - and β -relaxations.

The probability of dropout was described in the selection model and CTS was conducted with a hypothetical drug to examine the impact of dropout on trial results. The study completion rate was 75% and dropouts were not random. Model parameters obtained with different imputation methods were mostly within 40% (range 0 to 63%) compared to the model without dropouts. CTS showed 0.3 points lower median pain scores and 3% lower coefficient of variation over the 12-week simulations when dropout was included.

PLGA microspheres with a size of around 40 μm and narrow size distribution (span value of 0.3) were prepared with a double emulsion membrane emulsification method. Gene expression programming (GEP) analysis was applied to design and formulate a batch of microspheres with controlled porosity that shows continuous release of blue dextran. Low porous microspheres with a high loading efficiency were formed at high polymer concentrations (30% w/w in the oil phase) and were characterized with a burst release <10% and a three-phasic release profile of blue dextran. Increasing porosity (10% w/w polymer concentrations), a sustained release of blue dextran was obtained albeit with up to 40% of burst release. The desired formulation, calculated by GEP, resulted in microspheres with 72% loading efficiency and intermediate porosity. Blue dextran was indeed released continuously in almost a zero order manner over a period of 3 months after an initial small burst release of 9%. By fine-tuning the porosity, the release profile of PLGA microspheres for macromolecules can be predicted and changed from a three-phasic to a continuous release.","Artificial neural networks Gene expression programing Loading capacity Loading efficiency Membrane emulsification Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) Polyvinyl alcohol Theoretical loading Volume-weighted mean droplet diameter Droplet diameter Membrane pore diameter Membrane porosity The buoyancy force The drag force of the continuous phase flow The inertial force of the dispersed phase flow The interfacial tension force Interfacial tension Dispersed phase flux Fraction of active membrane pores Viscosity of the dispersed phase Continuous phase pressure Pressure of the continuous phase at the inlet and outlet of the main channel Critical transmembrane pressure Dispersed phase pressure Transmembrane pressure Dispersed phase flow rate Correlation coefficient Hydraulic membrane resistance Radius of the membrane pore Period of drop detachment","This research forms part of the Project P3.02 DESIRE of the research program of the BioMedical Materials institute, co-funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs.

The binding of NMSO3-liposomes to CHO-P cells was much stronger than that to the parental CHO-K1 cells. Fluorescence microscopic observation showed that NMSO3-liposomes were incorporated into CHO-P cells after the binding and distributed throughout the cytoplasm of the cell.

However, controversy remains regarding the optimal treatment strategies. Paclitaxel is believed to be a good compound for IPEC treatment because of its favourable pharmacokinetic properties. Rat experiments were set up to gain insight in PTX’s pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after IPEC treatment with Taxol®. Afterwards a Pharmacokinetic—Pharmacodynamic model was developed, that concurrently describes plasma and tumour exposure post IPEC dosing. Moreover, the developed model adequately describes the time-course of tumour apoptosis as well as the treatment effect on tumour volume. We show that the complex absorption processes underlying PTX absorption from the peritoneal cavity post IPEC dosing, give rise to a markedly non-linear dose response relationship. Furthermore, we show that, in order to optimize treatment efficiency whilst concurrently minimizing the possibility of systemic toxicities, lowering the dose and extending exposure to the cytotoxic solution is the way forward.

In order to understand the origin of increased stability of amorphous system inter- and intramolecular interactions between IMC and acMAL were studied. The amorphous IMC, acMAL and binary mixtures (IMC–acMAL) with different weight ratios were analyzed by using Dielectric Spectroscopy (DS), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), Raman Spectroscopy, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship (QSAR). Our studies have revealed that indomethacin mixed with acetylated saccharide forms homogeneous mixture. Interestingly, even a small amount of modified maltose prevents from recrystallization of amorphous indomethacin. FTIR measurements and QSAR calculations have shown that octaacetylmaltose significantly affects the concentration of indomethacin dimers. Moreover, with increasing the amount of acMAL in the amorphous solid dispersion molecular interactions between matrix and API become more dominant than IMC-IMC ones. Structural investigations with the use of X-ray diffraction technique have demonstrated that binary mixture of indomethacin with acMAL does not recrystallize upon storage at room temperature for more than 1.5 year. Finally, it was shown that acMAL can be used to improve solubility of IMC. Acetylated derivative of maltose might be very effective agent to improve physical stability of amorphous indomethacin as well as to enhance its solubility.

Net charge, ξ-potential and pI of Fv regions were found to correlate with viscosities of highly concentrated antibody solutions. Negative net charges on the Fv regions of two mAbs with poor viscosity behaviors facilitate attractive self-associations, causing them to diffuse slower than a well-behaved mAb with positive net charge on its Fv region.

Dried solid dispersions were compressed using different compression pressure but constant dwell time. MDSC and XRPD were used to characterize and study the effect of compression on the system. The solid dispersions showed a single T  till 20% drug loading after which two T ’s were observed. Application of compression to the phase separated 30 and 40% compositions induced mixing resulting in only a single T . This reduction in number of T ’s upon compression is a result of mixing which can be attributed to polymer flow resulting in reduction of the domain size of different phases in the solid dispersions. Application of compression can influence the phase behavior of Miconazole-PVP VA64 solid dispersions. This observation may have drastic impact on the formulation development approach for solid dispersions to be administered as tablets.",Active pharmaceutical ingredient Amorphous solid dispersions Heat capacity Heat of fusion Modulated differential scanning calorimetry Polyvinylpyrrolidone K25 Poly (1-vinylpyrrolidone-co-vinyl acetate) Refrigerated cooling system Glass transition temperature Width of the glass transition temperature Melting point Melting point depression,The authors acknowledge financial support from FWO-Vlaanderen (G.0764.13).

This paper investigates the effect of biodegradable polymer shell thickness on pulsatile protein release from biodegradable polymer microcapsules. Using precision particle fabrication (PPF) technology, monodisperse microcapsules were fabricated encapsulating bovine serum albumin (BSA) in a liquid core surrounded by a drug-free poly(lactide- -glycolide) (PLG) shell of uniform, controlled thickness from 14 to 19 μm. When using high molecular weight PLG (Mw 88 kDa), microparticles exhibited the desired core-shell structure with high BSA loading and encapsulation efficiency (55–65%). These particles exhibited very slow release of BSA for several weeks followed by rapid release of 80–90% of the encapsulated BSA within 7 days. Importantly, with increasing shell thickness the starting time of the pulsatile release could be controlled from 25 to 35 days. Biodegradable polymer microcapsules with precisely controlled shell thickness provide pulsatile release with enhanced control of release profiles.",,"This work was supported by the National Institute of Health Grant EB005181 and GM085222.

We investigated the influence of dose collection method, membrane holder type and the presence of surfactants on the dissolution process. Furthermore, we modeled the   dissolution process to identify influencing factors on the dissolution process of inhaled formulations based on the Nernst-Brunner equation. A homogenous distribution of the powder was required to eliminate mass dependent dissolution profiles. This was also found by modeling the dissolution process under ideal conditions. Additionally, it could be shown that influence on the diffusion pathway depends on the solubility of the substance. We demonstrated that the use of 0.02% DPPC in the dissolution media results in the most discriminating and reproducible dissolution profiles. In the model section we demonstrated that the dissolution process depends strongly on saturation solubility and particle size.

The percutaneous absorption of clobetasol propionate from five commercial products was measured   using cryopreserved human skin. The pharmacodynamic potency of the same five products was also assessed   using the VC assay, the surrogate method by which regulatory authorities in the United States establish the bioequivalence of generic topical glucocorticoid products. IVPT found total clobetasol absorption varying ten-fold from highest to lowest product, whereas the VC assay found this same difference was less than two-fold. The coefficient of variation ranged from 78 to 126% in the VC assay, but only 30–43% for IVPT. Statistically, IVPT could separate the 5 products into three groups: 1) ointment, 2) cream and gel, 3) emollient cream and solution). Due to its greater variability as well as saturation of the pharmacodynamic response at higher flux levels, the VC assay found all products except the solution to be equipotent.

Polyplexes prepared with PEG-PAMD inhibited invasion of cancer cells to an extent similar to the commercial CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor. Negative effect of PEG on transfection activity of PEG-PAMD polyplexes could be overcome by using polyplexes formulated with a mixture of PAMD and PEG-PAMD.

Gelatin was electrospun into fibers and converted into an sIPN following eosin Y-initiated polymerization of polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEG-DA). The cytocompatibility, degradation rate and mechanical properties were examined in the resulting sIPNs with various ratios of PEG-DA to eosin Y to find a suitable formulation for transbuccal drug delivery. Insulin was co-electrospun with gelatin into fibers and converted into an sIPN-GIF using this suitable formulation. The   release kinetics of insulin was evaluated using ELISA. The bioactivity of released insulin was analyzed in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes using Western blotting and Oil Red O staining. The transbuccal permeability of released insulin was determined using an   porcine oral mucosa model. The sIPN-GF formulation of GF cross-linked by PEG-DA (1%  ) with eosin Y (5%  ) possessed no cytotoxic effect, a moderate degradation rate with degradation half-life of 49 min, and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties. This formulation was used to fabricate sIPN-GIF. Insulin release was extended up to 4 h by sIPN-GIF. The released insulin successfully triggered intracellular AKT phosphorylation and induced adipocyte differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The transbuccal permeability of released insulin was determined on the order of 10  cm/s.

The objective of this study was to develop a reliable method for determination of internalization rate constant (k ) and to demonstrate its utility. This method utilized confocal imaging to record the internalization kinetics of fluorescence-tagged biopharmaceuticals in live-cells and a quantitative image-analysis algorithm for k  determination. K  was incorporated into a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) model for simulation of the drug PK profiles, target occupancy and the displacement of endogenous ligand. The method was highly sensitive, allowing k  determination in cells expressing as low as 5,000 receptors/cell, and was amenable to adherent and suspension cells. Its feasibility in a mixed cell population, such as whole blood, was also demonstrated. Accurate assessment of the k  was largely attributed to continuous monitoring of internalization in live cells, rapid confocal image acquisition and quantitative image-analysis algorithm. Translational PK-PD simulations demonstrated that k  is a major determinant of the drug PK profiles, target occupancy, and the displacement of endogenous ligand. The developed method is robust for broad cell types.

The chemical degradation by autoxidation of a diverse series of APIs has been investigated with molecular modelling tools. A set of 45 organic compounds was used to test and validate the various computational settings. Aiming to devise a methodology that could reliably perform a risk assessment for potential sensibility to autoxidation, different types of APIs, known for their autoxidation history were inspected.

The Local Density Approximation (LDA) gave the fastest results but with a substantial deviation (systematic over-estimation) to known experimental values.

We report here on the elaboration and immunostimulatory potential of polylactide (PLA)-based micelles core-loaded with imiquimod TLR7 ligand and able to be further surface-functionalized with antigenic protein (HIV-1 Gag p24) for antigen delivery purpose. Micelles prepared from poly(D,L-lactide)-b-poly(N-acryloxysuccinimide-co-N-vinylpyrrolidone) amphiphilic copolymer were incubated in the presence of imiquimod, leading to 1.2 wt% loading, and further conjugated to p24 antigen through reaction of p24 lysines and N-terminal amine with the N-succinimidyl pendant groups of the micelle corona. The impact of imiquimod encapsulation in the micelles on its immunostimulatory properties was investigated  , by monitoring: (i) the NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathways through experiments with RAW-Blue™ cells, a mouse macrophage cell line encoding an NF-κB/AP-1-inducible reporter construct; (ii) human dendritic cells (DCs) maturation markers by flow cytometry. RAW-Blue™ cells based experiments showed that imiquimod encapsulated in the micelles was much more efficient to activate the NF-κB and MAPK pathways than free imiquimod. Furthermore, encapsulated imiquimod was found to induce much higher maturation of DCs than the free analog. Finally, these immunostimulatory properties of the loaded imiquimod were shown to be conserved when the p24 antigen was coupled at the micelle surface.

In addition to the poor sensitivity in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV ), numerous causes are known to contribute to this phenomenon, which can be clustered into drug-, disease- and design-related factors. Here we present a model-based approach to describe disease progression, treatment response and dropout in clinical trials with COPD patients. Data from six phase II trials lasting up to 6 months were used. Disease progression (trough FEV  measurements) was modelled by a time–varying function, whilst the treatment effect was described by an indirect response model. A time-to-event model was used for dropout All relevant parameters were characterised with acceptable precision. Two parameters were necessary to model the dropout patterns, which was found to be partly linked to the treatment failure. Disease severity at baseline, previous use of corticosteroids, gender and height were significant covariates on disease baseline whereas disease severity and reversibility to salbutamol/salmeterol were significant covariates on E  for salmeterol active arm.

This study focuses on the efficiency of stabilizers with various molecular compositions and structures to stabilize drug nanocrystals. Five structurally different polymers were chosen as stabilizers for indomethacin nanocrystals. The affinity of polymers onto drug surfaces was measured using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and contact angle techniques. Nanosuspensions were prepared using the wet-ball milling technique and their physico-chemical properties were thoroughly characterized. SPR and contact angle measurements correlated very well with each other and showed that the binding efficiency decreased in the order L64 > 17R4 > F68 ≈ T908 ≈ T1107, which is attributed to the reduced PPO/PEO ratio and different polymer structures. The electrostatic interactions between the protonated amine of poloxamines and ionized indomethacin enhanced neither the affinity nor the properties of nanosuspensions, such as particle size and physical stability. A good stabilizer should have high binding efficiency, full coverage, and optimal hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance. A high affinity combined with short PEO chains (L64, 17R4) caused poor physical stability of nanosuspensions, whereas moderate binding efficiencies (F68, T908, T1107) with longer PEO chains produced physically stable nanosuspensions.",,"The authors acknowledge The Finnish Funding Agency for Innovation (TEKES, Finland; NanoForm project 40187/11) China Scholarship Council and The Academy of Finland for financial support.

754,,,[],"Neutropenia is a major dose-limiting side effect of chemotherapy and is closely related to febrile neutropenia which mainly occurs during the first cycle. Our objectives were to establish model-based decision rules from early absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) to anticipate prolonged high grade neutropenia at cycle 1 and to prevent it through delayed granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration in carboplatin-treated patients. The decision rules were built from Monte Carlo simulations performed with a previously published semi-mechanistic model describing ANC time-course in carboplatin-treated patients with or without concomitant G-CSF therapy. ANC measured at day 0 (D0, baseline), D4 and D5 were good predictors of prolonged high grade neutropenia at cycle 1. Pegfilgrastim administration on D5 was as effective as the conventional pegfilgrastim administration on D1 but none avoided prolonged high grade neutropenia in all patients. Additional decision rules were thus derived, using the same ANC combination, to identify patients for whom G-CSF was beneficial. All decision rules showed good performances (sensitivity/specificity). We propose an innovative approach to guide oncologist in their clinical practice. The next step is to perform prospective studies to implement, validate and possibly refine the proposed decision rules.",Absolute neutrophils counts Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor Receiver-operating characteristic,We have no competing interest to declare.,chemotherapy decision rule G-CSF neutropenia semi-mechanistic model,2015

Protein carbonylation is an irreversible oxidative modification and has been identified as a hallmark of severe oxidative stress but not extensively studied for its impact on the stability and activity of therapeutic proteins. We describe the application of a modified ELISA-based method to quantify global levels of carbonyl modification of complex proteins. We investigated protein oxidation of large protein molecules (transferrin, rabbit IgG, or β-glucosidase) and complex protein samples (human plasma) that were either stored in different buffer formulations, with varying amounts of divalent iron, or under different storage temperatures to determine the impact of different physicochemical stresses on carbonyl modifications. The modified ELISA allows for sensitive and specific carbonyl quantification with measurements that closely match those determined with the conventional spectrophotometric method. The method was useful for complex protein mixtures such as cell lysates without the need for additional procedures to remove DNA and RNA. Our findings demonstrate significant oxidative modification of each of the proteins stored in commonly used buffers and excipients at 37°C, 23°C, and 4°C. The carbonyl levels were further exacerbated with addition of trace amounts of Fe . We also measured the extent of protein aggregation under oxidizing conditions.

Cocrystals were identified with DSC, XRD and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM) and further characterized by SEM, specific surface area, wetting ability, solubility and dissolution testing. Judging by DSC, XRD and CRM, cocrystals with high purity could be produced with the RESS technique. Micronization   RESS was successful, since the specific surface area of RESS cocrystals was increased almost tenfold in comparison to cocrystals produced by slow solvent evaporation. Due to the additional micronization, the mean dissolution time of IBU from RESS cocrystals was decreased. RESS cocrystallization offers the advantage of combining micronization and cocrystallization in a single production step.

Amorphous glycopyrrolate particles with and without excipients (Distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) or β-cyclodextrin (βCD)) were spray dried and cold filled along with HFA 134a into customized thermal activity monitor (TAM) measurement ampoules. When applicable, a known amount of water was also pipetted into the ampoule. Sample ampoules were hermetically sealed, equilibrated to 25°C and measured isothermally for at least 24 h using the TAM III (TA Instruments, Sollentuna, Sweden). Amorphous glycopyrrolate particles were highly unstable and crystallized rapidly when suspended in HFA 134a. Co-spray drying the glycopyrrolate with DSPC failed to mitigate this instability, but co-spray drying with βCD protected the amorphous glycopyrrolate from crystallization, resulting in a stable formulation at low water contents (≤100 ppm). This study shows that isothermal microcalorimetry can easily differentiate between physically stable and unstable pMDI formulations of glycopyrrolate within a few hours.

The exenatide-loaded nanoparticles were prepared with modified chitosan which was conjugated with a goblet cell-target peptide, CSKSSDYQC (CSK) peptide. The CSK-chitosan nanoparticles shown reduced chitosan toxicity and enhanced the permeation of drugs across the Caco-2/HT-29 co-cultured cell monolayer, which simulated the intestinal epithelium. Following the oral administration of near-infrared fluorescent probe Cy-7-loaded NPs to mice, the distribution of the drugs was investigated with a near-infrared   image system (FX Pro, Bruker, USA).

Radiolabeled proteins were used for evaluation of blood clearance and tissue uptake profiles in an orthotopic breast tumor xenograft mouse model.

DLS and microDSC data revealed that the micellisation process was not affected by the protein, as demonstrated by unaltered micellar size and thermodynamic parameters. While the presence of BSA in the copolymer system reduced gel consistency, the hydrogel release performance was only slightly affected.

Although there was no change in systemic clearance elicited by 1,25(OH) D , brain extracellular fluid quinidine concentrations were lower in treated rats. We noted that insertion of indwelling catheters increased plasma protein binding of quinidine and serial sampling decreased the blood:plasma concentration ratio, factors that alter distribution ratios in microdialysis studies. After appropriate correction, K  and K , or ratios of quinidine unbound concentrations in brain extracellular fluid to plasma or blood at steady-state, were more than halved.

A validated isotope label-free method was established for absolute and simultaneous quantification of 9 CYPs (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D, 2E1 and 3A4) and 5 UGTs (1A1, 1A4, 1A6, 1A9 and 2B7) in human liver microsomes using LC-MS/MS. The LC-MS/MS method displayed excellent dynamic range (at least 250-fold) and high sensitivity for each of the signature peptides with acceptable recovery, accuracy and precision. The protein expression profile of CYP and UGT isoforms were then determined in match microsomes samples prepared from patients with HBV-positive human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In the tumor microsomes, the average absolute amounts of 8 major CYP isoforms (except CYP2C19) and 3 UGT isoforms (UGT1A1, UGT1A4 and UGT2B7) were decreased significantly (  < 0.05), whereas UGT1A6 and UGT1A9 levels were unchanged (  > 0.05). In addition, among isoforms with altered expression, 6 of 8 CYP isoforms and all three UGT isoforms were much more variable in tumor microsomes. Lastly, the importance of CYP3A4 was greatly diminished whereas the importance of UGT1A6 was enhanced in tumor microsomes. The use of an isotope label-free absolute quantification method for the simultaneous determination of 9 CYPs and 5 UGTs in human liver microsomes reveals that expression levels of CYPs and UGTs in human liver are severely impact by HCC, which could impact drug metabolism, disposition and pharmacotherapy.","Collision energy Collision cell exit potential Cytochrome P450 Declustering potential Hepatitis B virus Hepatocellular carcinoma Human liver microsomes Human liver microsomes prepared from pericarcinomatous tissue of a single donor with HCC Pooled human liver microsomes prepared from pericarcinomatous tissues of 15 donors, which contain same amount of donor microsomes from each subject Reference human liver microsomes Solid-phase extraction Human liver microsomes prepared from tumor tissue of a single donor with HCC Pooled human liver microsomes prepared from tumor tissues of 15 donors, which contain same amount of donor microsomes from each subject Uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferases Ultra performance liquid chromatography","This work was supported by grants from the Key International Joint Research Project of National Natural Science Foundation of China (81120108025) and the Central Platform Project from Department of Education of Guangdong Province to Dr. Zhongqiu Liu.

Ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX) assay, in addition to UV/VIS and  H NMR spectroscopies were applied to characterise the composition of the PS80 solution after storage. Multivariate Curve Resolution (MCR) and PLS analysis was used to establish correlation between quality of the PS80 solution and the RCP obtained after labelling. The levels of unsaturated fatty acid moieties of PS80 were negatively correlated to RCP of [ F]Flutemetamol after synthesis. This explains the slight increase in RCP when stored PS80 solutions were applied in the synthesis. The mechanism behind this observation is suggested to be related to radiation induced radical formation in the unsaturated fatty acids, which subsequently causes instability of the PET tracer. UV/VIS spectroscopy was demonstrated to have the ability as a possible control tool for quality assurance of the studied radioactive labelling process.

A thin-film hydration and extrusion method was used to fabricate the PEGylated liposomal membranes followed by a freeze and thaw process. A novel active drug loading method was developed using ammonium sulphate gradient as an influx driving force of ASL solubilized with sulfobutyl ether-β-cyclodextrin (SBE-β-CD). DL was maximized by optimizing liposomal preparation and loading conditions. Pharmacokinetics was evaluated following i.v. infusion in rabbits. Freeze-thaw resulted in unilamellar liposome formation (180 nm) free of micelles. Higher DL was obtained when dialysis was used to remove the untrapped ammonium sulphate compared to ultracentrifuge. The pH and SBE-β-CD level in the loading solution played key roles in enhancing DL. High DL ASL-liposomes (8.9% , drug-to-lipid mole ratio 26%) were obtained with some drug “bundles” in the liposomal cores and were stable in a 5% glucose solution for >80 days with minimal leakage (<2%). Surprisingly, following administration of ASL-liposomes prepared with or without SBE-β-CD, the half-lives were similar to the drug solution despite an increased area under the curve, indicating drug leakage from the carriers.

HA of different Mw was covalently grafted onto model polystyrene nanoparticles and advanced surface analysis by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy performed to quantify and evaluate the effect of the coating procedure. Specific CD44-mediated retargeting was investigated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy using isogenic D44-deficient and CD44-expressing MCF-7 breast adenocarcinoma cells. Surface analysis demonstrated effective surface coating with 33, 260 and 900 kDa HA resulting in increased colloidal stability and highly negative surface charge due to presentation of up to 4.7% carboxyl groups that indicates an extended and non-constricted HA polymer surface. Reduced non-specific particle interaction in CD44  cells was shown for all HA nanoshells but CD44-dependent cellular retargeting and internalization in CD44  cells was highly dependent on the coating HA Mw properties. The combination of advanced surface characterization and evaluation of particle interactions in isogenic cells with and without CD44 receptor demonstrates direct evidence for the dual capacity of HA for stealth and CD44-mediated retargeting tunable by the HA molecular weight.","Coding DNA sequence

An influenza peptide vaccine that elicits these CTLs would therefore be an alternative to current influenza vaccines, which are not cross-reactive. However, peptide antigens are poorly immunogenic due to lack of delivery to antigen presenting cells, and therefore need additional formulation with a suitable delivery system. In this study, the potential of virosomes as a delivery system for an influenza T-cell peptide was investigated.

As an alternative, we have developed a non-destructive technology to analyze the integrity of epidermal equivalents based on impedance spectroscopy. RHEs were generated and impedance spectra were recorded. from these spectra, we extrapolated electrical characteristics such as the capacitance and the ohmic resistance. Furthermore, the measurable electrical parameters were used to quantify the effects of mechanical and chemical disruption of the epidermal integrity. A fully matured RHE exhibits typical impedance spectra in a frequency ranging between 1 Hz and 100 kHz, which is comparable to the spectra of freshly isolated human epidermal biopsies. We could show that, during RHE maturation, these characteristics change significantly. Thus, capacitance and ohmic resistance can be employed as a criterion for the quality control of skin equivalents. Additionally, our application of impedance spectroscopy reveals sufficient sensitivity to detect a transient decreased ohmic resistance caused by 2-propanol, which is classified as a non-irritant by MTT assays.

Clarithromycin was deposited on the air-interface culture of Calu-3 cells using a modified Andersen cascade impactor. Transport of fluorescein-Na, production of mucus and interleukin-8 release from Calu-3 cells following stimulation with transforming growth factor-β and treatment with clarithromycin was investigated. The deposition of clarithromycin had significant effect on the permeability of fluorescein-Na, suggesting that the barrier integrity was improved following a short-term treatment with clarithromycin (apparent permeability values were reduced to 3.57 × 10  ± 2.32 × 10  cm.s , compared to 1.14 × 10  ± 4.30 × 10  cm.s  for control). Furthermore, the amount of mucus produced was significantly reduced during the course of clarithromycin treatment. The concentration of interleukin-8 secreted from Calu-3 cells following stimulation with transforming growth factor-β resulted in significantly lower level of interleukin-8 released from the cells pre-treated with clarithromycin (5.2 ± 0.5 ng.ml  clarithromycin treated  . 7.7 ± 0.8 ng.ml  control, respectively).

API preparations were characterized in solid state by single crystal and powder diffraction, NMR, DSC, IR and in solution by NMR and ESI-MS. Dissolution and precipitation kinetics were detailed as was the role of the counterion on API supersaturation. Transepithelial API transport through Caco-2 monolayers and counterion cytotoxicity were assessed. The mechanism leading to a 700 fold faster dissolution rate and longer duration of API supersaturation of the ionic liquid in comparison to the free acid was deciphered. Transepithelial transport was about three times higher for the IL in comparison to the prodrug when substances were applied as suspensions with the higher solubility of the IL outpacing the higher permeability of the prodrug. The counterion was nontoxic with IC  values in the upper μM / lower mM range in cell lines of hepatic and renal origin as well as in macrophages.

These regimens are frequently used in empiric therapy when risk factors for MRSA are present, but MSSA will often turn out as pathogen. Checkerboard and time-kill curve studies were performed against three strains of MSSA covering clinically relevant concentrations of all antibiotics. We newly elaborated a response surface analysis (RSA) to quantify the extent of the pharmacodynamic interactions. The most prominent result was that linezolid fully antagonised the rapid (4–6 h) bactericidal effect of meropenem against MSSA to bacteriostasis at clinically relevant concentrations of both drugs. This interaction was invisible in the conventional checkerboard analysis (insensitive turbidity threshold). RSA quantified a 1.5–3.2 log -fold higher bacterial load compared to expected additivity for linezolid and meropenem. Vancomycin and meropenem interacted partly synergistic (subinhibitory) or additive (inhibitory combinations) being bactericidal after 24 h. Standard doses of linezolid and meropenem will provide inhibitory concentrations and thus pharmacodynamic antagonism throughout the whole dosing interval for MSSA. Further data is required to assess the clinical significance of this interaction.","American type culture collection Bliss independence Drug concentration Cation-adjusted Mueller Hinton broth Colony forming unit Antibacterial effect Drug concentration at which the half-maximum effect is observed Maximum drug effect Growth control Hill factor expressing the steepness of the concentration-effect relationship Intensity of the antibacterial effect Linezolid Meropenem Minimal inhibitory concentration Methicillin-resistant

A pre-insertion or post-insertion technique was used for PSL PEGylation. For the first time, confocal laser scanning microscopy coupled with a modified calcein self-quench assay was applied to evaluate the endosome escape capability. PSL cellular uptake was evaluated using macrophages and the cytotoxicity using a gemcitabine (model drug)-resistant MIA PaCa-2 cells. The pharmacokinetics of PSL encapsulated gemcitabine was investigated in rats. PEGylation reduced the pH-sensitivity in a concentration-dependent manner (0.5–5% mol). Both PEGylation methods reduced the uptake of PSL by macrophages by over 60%. Cytotoxicity was ranked in the order: post-inserted PSL ≥ pre-inserted PSL > non-PSL > gemcitabine solution, consistent with the confocal microscopic observation and pH-sensitivity. Both pre and post-inserted PSL resulted in significant reductions (  < 0.05) in plasma clearance (58.6 and 38.4 ml/h/kg), increases in the area-under-the-concentration-time curve (56.9 and 87.1 μM· h) and half-life (6.1 and 6.2 h) compared to gemcitabine solution (152.9 ml/h/kg, 22.2 μM· h and 1.4 h).

There are multiple endocrine and paracrine factors that promote chondrogenesis at the growth plate, which could potentially be used to treat these disorders. Targeting these growth factors specifically to the growth plate might augment the therapeutic skeletal effect while diminishing undesirable effects on non-target tissues.

The ability of the selected antibody fragments to bind matrilin-3 and to bind cartilage tissue   and   was assessed by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. We identified antibody fragments that bound matrilin-3 with high affinity and also bound with high tissue specificity to cartilage homogenates and to cartilage structures in mouse embryo sections.

As a biosynthetic drug, the protein undergoes strict monitoring aiming for detection and characterization of impurities. The goal of this study was to isolate and identify a derivative of insulin lispro formed during biosynthesis. For this purpose, ion exchange chromatography in combination with endoproteinase Glu-C digestion, MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry and Edman sequencing were employed. Ion exchange chromatography analysis of related proteins in development batches of recombinant insulin lispro revealed the existence of unknown derivative in excess of the assumed limit. Its molecular mass was 42 Da higher than the theoretical mass of Lys(B31) insulin lispro—one of the expected process-related intermediates. Endoproteinase Glu-C cleavage enabled indication of the modified peptide. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) allowed to explore the location and type of the modification. The 42 amu shift was present in the mass of y-type ions, while b-type ions were in agreement with theoretical values. It suggested that the modification is present on B31 lysine. Further inquiry revealed the presence of two diagnostic ions for lysine acetylation at m/z 143.1 and 126.1. In addition, the peptide was isolated and sequenced by Edman degradation.

This is examined and demonstrated for the case of solid dispersions of nifedipine in a polymeric substrate. Solid dispersions consisting of nifedipine and polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer (Soluplus®) were prepared by freeze drying, melting and solvent evaporation at drug loadings of 10, 30, 50, 70 and 90%  . Drug-polymer interactions in the amorphous solid dispersion were estimated by Raman spectroscopy. The correlation between the solid state stability of the drug in a solid dispersion and the extent of drug-polymer interaction was monitored by X-ray diffractometry. The miscibility limit of nifedipine-Soluplus® was found to be 30%   drug loading for all preparation methods. The drug was found to interact with Soluplus®, through a hydrophilic interaction identified by infrared spectroscopy and a hydrophobic interaction which could be quantified by Raman spectroscopy. The average extent of the drug-polymer interaction in the studied amorphous samples at equivalent drug loading was similar, regardless of the preparation method. Inhomogeneities in samples prepared by melting contributed to a wider variation in drug-polymer interaction and poorer solid state stability, in terms of its crystallization tendency. Raman spectroscopy was shown to be a useful technique in classifying miscibility levels based on the hydrophobic interaction between the drug and the polymer.

We report the synthesis and use in an orthotopic mouse model of PLGA-PEG nanoparticles encapsulating toremifene and nanoparticles encapsulating toremifene that are also conjugated to anti-PSMA for targeted prostate tumor delivery. Human prostate cancer cell line PC3M and a nude mouse model were used to test efficacy of nano-targeted and nano-encapsulated toremifene   free toremifene on the growth and differentiation of tumor cells. Treatment with free toremifene resulted in a significant reduction in growth of prostate tumor and proliferation, and its nano-targeting resulted in greater reduction of prostate tumor growth, greater toremifene tumor uptake, and enhanced tumor necrosis. Tumors from animals treated with nano-encapsulated toremifene conjugated with anti-PSMA showed about a 15-fold increase of toremifene compared to free toremifene.

Hydration and drug release kinetics of the caplets were investigated and fitted to a diffusion model. For the formulations with lower drug loadings, the drug was found to be in the non-crystalline state, while for the ones with higher drug loadings paracetamol is mostly crystalline. Release was found to be largely independent of drug loading but strongly dependent upon device dimensions, and predominately governed by a Fickian diffusion mechanism, while the hydration kinetics shows the features of Case II diffusion.

811,,,[],"Experimental Blood–Brain Barrier (BBB) permeability models for drug molecules are expensive and time-consuming. As alternative methods, several traditional Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship (QSAR) models have been developed previously. In this study, we aimed to improve the predictivity of traditional QSAR BBB permeability models by employing relevant public bio-assay data in the modeling process. We compiled a BBB permeability database consisting of 439 unique compounds from various resources. The database was split into a modeling set of 341 compounds and a validation set of 98 compounds. Consensus QSAR modeling workflow was employed on the modeling set to develop various QSAR models. A five-fold cross-validation approach was used to validate the developed models, and the resulting models were used to predict the external validation set compounds. Furthermore, we used previously published membrane transporter models to generate relevant transporter profiles for target compounds. The transporter profiles were used as additional biological descriptors to develop hybrid QSAR BBB models. The consensus QSAR models have R  = 0.638 for five-fold cross-validation and R  = 0.504 for external validation. The consensus model developed by pooling chemical and transporter descriptors showed better predictivity (R  = 0.646 for five-fold cross-validation and R  = 0.526 for external validation).

Copolymers of phenylboronic acid-functional poly(amido amine)s, differing in the content of primary amine (DAB-BA-PAA) or alcohol (ABOL-BA-PAA) side groups, were synthesized and applied in the formation of multilayers with PVA and ChS. Biocompatibility of the resulting films was evaluated through cell culture experiments with COS-7 cells grown on the films. PVA-based multilayers were thin, reaching ~100 nm at 10 bilayers, whereas ChS-based multilayers were thick, reaching ~600 nm at the same number of bilayers. All of the multilayers are stable under physiological conditions   and are responsive to reducing agents, owing to the presence of disulfide bonds in the polymers. PVA-based films were demonstrated to be responsive to glucose at physiological pH at the investigated glucose concentrations (10–100 mM). The multilayered films displayed biocompatibility in cell culture experiments, promoting attachment and proliferation of COS-7 cells. Responsive thin films based on boronic acid functional poly(amido amine)s are promising biocompatible materials for biomedical applications, such as drug releasing surfaces on stents or implants.","4-((4-aminobutylamino)methyl)phenylboronic acid AlamarBlue 4-aminobutanol p(CBA-ABOL50%/4AMPBA50%) Boronic acid Phenylboronic acid-functional poly(amido amine)s

The objective of this work was to examine the viscosity of highly concentrated solutions of a high purity IgG  monoclonal antibody over a wide range of protein concentrations, solution pH, ionic strength, and in the presence / absence of different excipients. Experiments were performed with an IgG  monoclonal antibody provided by Amgen. The steady-state viscosity was evaluated using a Rheometrics strain-controlled rotational rheometer with a concentric cylinder geometry. The viscosity data were well-described by the Mooney equation. The data were analyzed in terms of the antibody virial coefficients obtained from osmotic pressure data evaluated under the same conditions. The viscosity coefficient in the absence of excipients was well correlated with the third osmotic virial coefficient, which has a negative value (corresponding to short range attractive interactions) at the pH and ionic strength examined in this work.

Five miconazole salts and four sertraline salts were selected for this study. The extent of conversion was quantified using Raman spectroscopy. A mathematical model was utilized to estimate the theoretical amount of conversion. A trend was observed that for a given series of salts of a particular basic compound (both sertraline and miconazole are bases), the extent of disproportionation increases as pH  decreases. Miconazole phosphate monohydrate and sertraline mesylate, although exhibiting significantly different pH  values (more than 2 units apart), underwent a similar extent of disproportionation, which may be attributed to the lower buffering capacity of sertraline salts. This work shows that the disproportionation tendency can be influenced by pH  and buffering capacity and thus highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate salt form during the screening process in order to avoid salt-to-free form conversion.",Active pharmaceutical ingredient Powder X-ray diffraction Relative humidity Thermogravimetric analysis Tribasic sodium phosphate dodecahydrate,"The Dane O’Kildsig Center for Pharmaceutical Processing Research is acknowledged for providing funding for this project.

In this study, a novel glycyrrhetinic acid (GA) and poly(L-Histidine) (PHIS) mediated polymeric drug delivery system was developed to target HCC that have GA binding receptors and release its encapsulated anticancer drug in the acidic microenvironment of HCC. Firstly, GA and PHIS were conjugated to form poly (ethylene glycol)-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (GA-PEG-PHIS-PLGA, GA-PPP) micelles by grafting reaction between active terminal groups. Secondly, andrographolide (AGP) was encapsulated to GA-PPP to make AGP/GA-PPP using the solvent evaporation method. The pH-responsive property of AGP/GA-PPP micelles was validated by monitoring its stability and drug release behavior in different pH conditions. Furthermore, selective hepatocellular uptake of GA-PPP micelles  , liver specific drug accumulation   as well as the enhanced antitumor effects of AGP/GA-PPP micelles confirmed the HCC targeting property of our novel drug delivery system. Average size of AGP/GA-PPP micelles increased significantly and the encapsulated AGP released faster   at pH 5.0, while micelles keeping stable in pH 7.4. AGP/GA-PPP micelles were uptaken more efficiently by human Hep3B liver cells than that by human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. GA-PPP micelles accumulated specifically in the liver and possessed long retention time  . AGP/GA-PPP micelles significantly inhibited tumor growth and provided better therapeutic outcomes compared to free AGP and AGP/PEG-PLGA(AGP/PP) micelles without GA and PHIS decoration.

We recently showed that a factor Xa based clotting time test could potentially assess the effect of enoxaparin on the clotting system. However, the test did not perform well in subsequent individuals and effectiveness of an exogenous phospholipid, Actin FS, in reducing the variability in the clotting time was assessed. The aim of this work was to conduct an adaptive pilot study to determine the range of concentrations of Xa and Actin FS to take forward into a proof-of-concept study. A nonlinear parametric function was developed to describe the response surface over the factors of interest. An adaptive method was used to estimate the parameters using a D-optimal design criterion. In order to provide a reasonable probability of observing a success of the clotting time test, a P-optimal design criterion was incorporated using a loss function to describe the hybrid DP-optimality. The use of adaptive DP-optimality method resulted in an efficient estimation of model parameters using data from only 6 healthy volunteers. The use of response surface modelling identified a range of sets of Xa and Actin FS concentrations, any of which could be used for the proof-of-concept study.

Furthermore, their antiatherogenic efficacies were elaborately evaluated and compared by typical biochemical indices. With AA modification amount augmenting, circulation time of AA-LT-d-rHDL was prolonged, and drug accumulation in the target locus was increased, eventually the significant appreciation in antiatherogenic efficacies were further supported by lower level of bad cholesterol, decreased atherosclerotic lesions areas and mean intima-media thickness (MIT), markedly attenuated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) protein expression and macrophage infiltration.

In this study, hCC49 single chain fragment variable (scFv)-displaying   virus-like particles (RSV VLPs) were produced in silkworm larvae to be a specific carrier of an anti-cancer drug. RSV VLPs displaying hCC49 scFv were created by the fusion of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of hemagglutinin from influenza A (H1N1) virus and produced in silkworm larvae. The display of hCC49 scFv on the surface of RSV VLPs was confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using tumor-associated glycoprotein-72 (TAG-72), fluorescent microscopy, and immunoelectron microscopy. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or doxorubicin (DOX) was incorporated into hCC49 scFv-displaying RSV VLPs by electroporation and specific targeting of these VLPs was investigated by fluorescent microscopy and cytotoxicity assay using LS174T cells. FITC was delivered to LS174T human colon adenocarcinoma cells by hCC49 scFv-displaying RSV VLPs, but not by RSV VLPs. This indicated that hCC49 scFv allowed FITC-loaded RSV VLPs to be delivered to LS174T cells.

(iii) Modulate salt crystallinity by annealing the frozen solution. Aqueous IMC solutions buffered with tris were freeze dried, with or without annealing the frozen solutions. The lyophiles were characterized by X-ray diffractometry, differential scanning calorimetry and infra-red spectroscopy and also subjected to water sorption and dissolution studies. Based on IR spectroscopy, the final lyophile was confirmed to contain the IMC tris salt. In the absence of annealing, the lyophile was X-ray amorphous with a glass transition temperature of 19°C. Annealing the frozen solutions caused a substantial increase in lyophile crystallinity. Interestingly, both the amorphous and partially crystalline lyophiles dissolved “instantaneously” and completely in the dissolution medium. In contrast, the crystalline IMC as well as its physical mixture with tris exhibited much slower dissolution with ~ 50% drug dissolved in 30 min.

Recently, salinomycin (SAL) has been identified as selective inhibitor of cancer stem cells (CSCs). In our study, we aimed to deliver SAL to gemcitabine-resistant PC by the aid of poly ethylene glycol-b-poly lactic acid (PEG-b-PLA) polymeric micelles (PMs). SAL-loaded PMs were prepared and investigated in terms of pharmaceutical properties. MTT and Annexin V/PI assays were used to study cell proliferation and apoptosis in AsPC-1 cells in response to treatment with SAL micellar formulations. Alterations in CSC phenotype, invasion strength, and mRNA expression of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers were also determined in the treated cells.   antitumor study was performed in Balb/c AsPC-1 xenograft mice. PM formulations of SAL were prepared in suitable size and loading traits. In gemcitabine-resistant AsPC-1 cells, SAL was found to significantly increase cell mortality and apoptosis. It was also observed that SAL micellar formulations inhibited invasion and harnessed EMT in spite of induced expression of Snail. The   antitumor experiment showed significant tumor eradication and the highest survival probability in mice treated with SAL PMs. The obtained results showed the efficacy of SAL nano-formulation against PC tumor cells.","Critical micelle concentration Cancer stem cells Dynamic light scattering Entrapment efficiency Epithelial to mesenchymal transition Enhanced permeability and retention Fetal bovine serum High performance liquid chromatography 50% inhibitory concentration Loading density 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide Nanoparticle Phosphate buffered saline Pancreatic cancer Polydispersity index Poly ethylene glycol-b-poly lactic acid Propidium iodide Polymeric micelles Real-time polymerase chain reaction Salinomycin Transmission electron microscopy Tetrahydrofuran",We would like to express our profound thanks to Dr. Babak Paknejad for his assistance in animal experiments.

Drug conjugation to dendrimer-based delivery systems has the potential to reduce toxicity, enhance lung retention and promote lymphatic distribution in rats. The current study therefore evaluated the pharmacokinetics and lung lymphatic exposure of a PEGylated dendrimer following inhaled administration. Plasma pharmacokinetics and disposition of a 22 kDa PEGylated dendrimer were compared after aerosol administration to rats and sheep. Lung-derived lymph could not be sampled in rats and so lymphatic transport of the dendrimer from the lung was assessed in sheep. Higher plasma concentrations were achieved when dendrimer was administered to the lungs of rats as a liquid instillation when compared to an aerosol. Plasma pharmacokinetics were similar between sheep and rats, although some differences in disposition patterns were evident. Unexpectedly, less than 0.5% of the aerosol dose was recovered in pulmonary lymph. The data suggest that rats provide a relevant model for assessing the pharmacokinetics of inhaled macromolecules prior to evaluation in larger animals, but that the pulmonary lymphatics are unlikely to play a major role in the absorption of nanocarriers from the lungs.",Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid Caudal mediastinal lymph duct Caudal mediastinal lymph node Alveolar macrophages Size exclusion chromatography,This work was funded by a strategic Monash research grant and an Australian Research Council Linkage grant.

834,,,[],"Ascorbic acid has been considered as a potential radical scavenging excipient for pharmaceutical formulations. However, under certain circumstances, ascorbic acid can generate reactive oxygen species   redox cycling. The objective of this study was to investigate ascorbic acid-induced oxidative carbonylation of therapeutic proteins and correlate the increase in carbonylation with protein aggregation. An optimized ELISA for quantifying carbonyl levels was used to compare the oxidizing potentials of ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide by testing four pharmaceutically-relevant proteins (human serum albumin, immunoglobulin G, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor and calcitonin). Several transition metals at micromolar concentrations were evaluated for their ability to enhance ascorbic acid-induced protein carbonylation. Protein aggregation under oxidative conditions, with or without free radical scavengers, was measured by aggregate binding fluorescent dye and confirmed by microfluidic imaging. Addition of ascorbic acid alone resulted in higher increases in carbonylation than addition of hydrogen peroxide. The presence of trace amounts (>75 ppb) of copper enhanced oxidative effects of ascorbic acid, whereas other tested metals did not comparably promote oxidation. During oxidation, protein destabilization indicated by loss of the full-length protein, positively correlated with the increase in protein aggregation. However, levels of aggregation did not always correlate with the levels of protein carbonylation. At comparable carbonylation levels, addition of copper produced greater protein destabilization and aggregation than addition of iron. The results strongly suggest that ascorbic acid with traces of metals, especially copper, can promote therapeutic protein carbonylation and potentially aggregation. At similar carbonylation levels, some oxidative conditions may lead to greater protein destabilization than others.","Adenosine triphosphate 9-(dicyanovinyl)julolidine 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazone 2,4-dinitrophenyl hydrazine Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor Recombinant human serum albumin Immunoglobulin G Microfluidic imaging Reactive oxygen species","This research was supported by the CDER Critical Path Initiative.

The pharmacokinetics of seven reference compounds (antipyrine, atenolol, cimetidine, diazepam, hydrochlorothiazide, midazolam and theophylline) was investigated after intravenous and oral dosing in minipigs. Supportive   data were generated on hepatocellularity, metabolic clearance in hepatocytes, blood cell and plasma protein binding and metabolism routes. Systemic plasma clearance for the seven drugs ranged from low (1.1 ml/min/kg, theophylline) to close to liver blood flow (37.4 ml/min/kg, cimetidine). Volume of distribution in minipigs ranged from 0.7 L/kg for antipyrine to 3.2 L/kg for hydrochlorothiazide. A gender-related difference of   metabolic clearance was observed for antipyrine. The hepatocellularity for minipig was determined as 124 Mcells/g liver, similar to the values reported for human. Based on these data a preliminary   to   correlation (IVIVC) for metabolic clearance measured in hepatocytes was investigated.

Bilastine has favorable characteristics for use in pediatrics but the PK/PD and the optimal dose in children had yet to be clinically explored. The purpose is to: (1) Develop an ontogenic predictive model of bilastine PK linked to the PD in adults by integrating current knowledge; (2) Use the model to design a PK study in children; (3) Confirm the selected dose and the study design through the evaluation of model predictability in the first recruited children; (4) Consider for inclusion the group of younger children (< 6 years). A semi-mechanistic approach was applied to predict bilastine PK in children assuming the same PD as described in adults. The model was used to simulate the time evolution of plasma levels and wheal and flare effects after several doses and design an adaptive PK trial in children that was then confirmed using data from the first recruits by comparing observations with model predictions. PK/PD simulations supported the selection of 10 mg/day in 2 to <12 year olds. Results from the first interim analysis confirmed the model predictions and design hence trial continuation. The model successfully predicted bilastine PK in pediatrics and optimally assisted the selection of the dose and sampling scheme for the trial in children.

HGH was photo-irradiated at λ = 254 and λ > 295 nm and tryptic digests were analyzed by HPLC-MS to investigate light-induced disulfide degradation pathways. A total of 60 products were detected, and structures/tentative structures were assigned to the products by MS  and MS  analysis. The main products were reduced Cys residues, dithiohemiacetal, thioether and disulfide scrambling products. In addition, we detected Cys degradation products such as Cys thioaldehyde, dehydroalanine (Dha), Ala, Ser semialdehyde, Ser, S-sulfocysteine, and Gly. Frequently, the tryptic fragments contained more than one modification, i.e. a Cys degradation product in close proximity to a dehydrated amino acid. Several novel cross-links were detected between Cys and Tyr, Cys, Ser and Phe, Cys and Trp, and Trp and Tyr. Photo-induced protein fragmentation was detected specifically at or in close proximity to the disulfide bond between T6 and T16. An in-house packed 75 cm nano-column enabled us to resolve various isomers/diastereomers of the photo-degradation products.

Schiff-base linked imidazole dendritic mesoporous silica nanoparticles (SL-IDMSN) were developed and employed to load doxorubicin (DOX) and survivin shRNA-expressing plasmid (iSur-pDNA) to form nanocomplexes. The nanoparticles were assessed by structural characterization, drug loading and release, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution, gene transfection,   anti-proliferation of hepatoma cells, and   tumor growth inhibition in H-22 tumor bearing mice. SL-IDMSN showed high loading capacity for both DOX and iSur-pDNA due to their hierarchical mesostructures. The cleavage of Schiff-base linkage on SL-IDMSN in the weakly acidic endosomes/lysosomes led to microenvironment-specific release of both DOX and iSur-pDNA. Meanwhile, the imidazole modification could trigger the efficient endosomal escape via proton sponge effect, thereby enhancing nuclear accumulation of iSur-pDNA and gene silencing efficiency. More importantly, these superior performances of SL-IDMSN resulted in their improved inhibitory effects on   cancer cell proliferation and   tumor growth.

870,,,[],"The aim of this research was to study the interplay of solid and solution state phase transformations during the dissolution of ritonavir (RTV) amorphous solid dispersions (ASDs). RTV ASDs with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyvinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate (PVPVA) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) were prepared at 10–50% drug loading by solvent evaporation. The miscibility of RTV ASDs was studied before and after exposure to 97% relative humidity (RH). Non-sink dissolution studies were performed on fresh and moisture-exposed ASDs. RTV and polymer release were monitored using ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. Techniques including fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal imaging, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) were utilized to monitor solid and the solution state phase transformations. All RTV-PVP and RTV-PVPVA ASDs underwent moisture-induced amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS) on high RH storage whereas RTV-HPMCAS ASDs remained miscible. Non-sink dissolution of PVP- and PVPVA-based ASDs at low drug loadings led to rapid RTV and polymer release resulting in concentrations in excess of amorphous solubility, liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and amorphous nanodroplet formation. High drug loading PVP- and PVPVA-based ASDs did not exhibit LLPS upon dissolution as a consequence of extensive AAPS in the hydrated ASD matrix. All RTV-HPMCAS ASDs led to LLPS upon dissolution. RTV ASD dissolution is governed by a competition between the dissolution rate and the rate of phase separation in the hydrated ASD matrix. LLPS was observed for ASDs where the drug release was polymer controlled and only ASDs that remained miscible during the initial phase of dissolution led to LLPS. Techniques such as fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal imaging and SEM were useful in understanding the phase behavior of ASDs upon hydration and dissolution and were helpful in elucidating the mechanism of generation of amorphous nanodroplets.",Amorphous solid dispersion Amorphous-amorphous phase separation Atomic force microscopy Differential scanning calorimetry Drug loading Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose acetate succinate Liquid-liquid phase separation Nanotracking analysis Polyvinylpyrrolidone Polyvinylpyrrolidone vinyl acetate Relative humidity Ritonavir Ultraviolet-visible,"Financial support to HSP from Migliaccio/Pfizer graduate fellowship is greatly acknowledged.

We propose to mitigate ocular toxicity without compromising sterility by incorporating a filter into an eye drop bottle to selectively remove BAK during the process of drop instillation. The filter is a packed bed of particles made from poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA), which is a common ophthalmic material. We showed that pHEMA particle prepared by using ethoxylated trimethylolpropane triacrylate as crosslinker can be incorporated into a modified eyedrop bottle tip to selectively remove the preservative as the formulation is squeezed out of the bottle. Hydraulic permeability of the plug is measured to determine the resistance to eye drop squeezing, and % removal of BAK and drugs are determined. The modified tip has a hydraulic permeability of about 2 Darcy, which allows eyedrops formulations to flow through without excessive resistance. The tip is designed such that the patients can create an eyedrop of solution of 1–10 cP viscosity in 4 s with a nominal pressure. During this short contact time, the packed particles removed nearly 100% of benzalkonium chloride (BAK) from a 15 mL, 0.012% BAK solution but have only minimal impact on the concentration of contained active components.

NPIs were purified from pharmaceutical-grade sucrose and spiked into trastuzumab, rituximab, infliximab, and cetuximab formulations. The stability of the mAbs as a function of storage time, temperature, and NPI concentration was assessed by visual inspection, flow-imaging microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, size-exclusion chromatography, capillary isoelectric focusing, and intrinsic differential scanning fluorimetry. NPIs negatively affected the stability of all mAbs, albeit it to different extents. After spiking with NPIs, trastuzumab formulations showed high numbers of μm-sized particles and turbidity, rituximab and cetuximab formulations contained high numbers of nm-sized particles, while infliximab formed nm- and μm-sized particles, and showed turbidity. Low-molecular-weight species were observed for rituximab and infliximab, whereas high-molecular-weight species were detected for cetuximab. Whereas the stability of trastuzumab and infliximab formulations was affected directly after spiking NPIs, degradation of rituximab and cetuximab was observed only after 14 weeks at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the stability of rituximab and infliximab was affected by NPI concentrations that are potentially present in final drug products.

The characterization of particle deposition remains difficult to achieve in experiments. Alternative numerical approach is applied to identify suitable aerosol particle size with maximized inhaled doses. This study numerically compared the drug delivery efficiency in a realistic human nasal cavity between two aerosol drug administration systems targeting the olfactory region: the aerosol mask system and the breath-powered bi-directional system. Steady inhalation and exhalation flow rates were applied to both delivery systems. The discrete phase particle tracking method was employed to capture the aerosol drug transport and deposition behaviours in the nasal cavity. Both overall and regional deposition characteristics were analysed in detail. The results demonstrated the breath-powered drug delivery approach can produce superior olfactory deposition with peaking olfactory deposition fractions for diffusive 1 nm particles and inertial 10 μm. While for particles in the range of 10 nm to 2 μm, no significant olfactory deposition can be found, indicating the therapeutic agents should avoid this size range when targeting the olfactory deposition.

878,,,[],"The use of soluble cocrystals is a promising strategy for delivering poorly soluble drugs. However, precipitation of poorly soluble crystal form during dissolution hinders the successful tablet development of cocrystals. This work was aimed to understand the mechanisms for improving dissolution performance of a soluble cocrystals by using excess coformer. A highly soluble carbamazepine (CBZ) cocrystal with– glutaric acid (GLA) was studied. Impact of excess GLA on solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate (IDR) was assessed. Viscosity of GLA solutions was also measured. Solid form of powders and pellets was examined using powder X-ray diffractometry. IDRs of cocrystal and GLA mixtures in different ratios were measured to identify a suitable formulation for maintaining high dissolution rate of CBZ-GLA in an aqueous environment. IDR of CBZ-GLA in a pH 1.2 HCl solution was improved when GLA was present in the solution. Precipitation of CBZ·2H O was eliminated when GLA concentration was ≥100 mg/mL. The improved IDR was accompanied by higher solubility of CBZ in GLA solution and increased solution viscosity. The trend in IDR profile matched well with the solubility profile normalized by solution viscosity. Mixture of cocrystal and GLA led to improved IDR in simulated intestinal fluid. The excess GLA increased the aqueous solubility of CBZ·2H O and, thereby, reduced the propensity to precipitation of CBZ·2H O during dissolution by lowering the degree of supersaturation. This strategy allowed development of a CBZ-GLA formulation with a significantly enhanced dissolution rate than CBZ-GLA.",Carbamazepine Carbamazepine - glutaric acid cocrystal Glutaric acid Intrinsic dissolution rate,We are grateful for resources from the Characterization Facility for the X-ray diffraction experiments and Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science in University of Minnesota for measuring viscosity.,carbamazepine cocrystal dissolution solubilization,2018

Four types of rat intestinal perfusion data were considered: single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) in the jejunum (  = 40), and colon (  = 15), closed-loop (Doluisio type) in the small intestine (  = 78), and colon (  = 74). Moreover,   Caco-2 permeability values were used to predict rat   values in the rat data studied. Comparable number of molecules permeate via paracellular water channels as by the lipoidal transcellular route in the SPIP method, although in the closed-loop method, the paracellular route appears dominant in the colon. The aqueous boundary layer thickness in the small intestine is comparable to that found in unstirred   monolayer assays; it is thinner in the colon. The mucosal surface area in anaesthetized rats is 0.96–1.4 times the smooth cylinder calculated value in the colon, and it is 3.1–3.6 times in the small intestine. The paracellular permeability of the intestine appeared to be greater in rat than human, with the colon showing more leakiness (higher  ) than the small intestine. Based on log intrinsic permeability values, the correlations between the   and   models ranged from r  0.82 to 0.92. The SPIP-Doluisio method comparison indicated identical log permeability selectivity trend with negligible bias.","Porosity of paracellular junction pores divided by the rate-limiting paracellular pathlength (cm ); size-restricted, cation-selective Secondary porosity-pathlength ratio (cm ); charge/size nonspecific “free diffusion” term Electrical potential drop (mV) across the electric field created by negatively-charged residues lining the junctional pores Aqueous boundary layer—adjacent to the surface of a cell monolayer or luminal side of intestine “smooth surface” area in intestinal segment (= 2π  ) of length   and effective radius   (cm ) Effective surface area (=  · ) of luminal absorptive surface in the intestine (cm ) Human cancer of the colon epithelial cell line Aqueous diffusivity (cm·s ) Dynamic range window: observable permeability, with   as top limit and   as bottom limit Function due to electrical potential drop across the cell junction (dimensionless) Concentration fraction in uncharged, positively-, and negatively-charged forms, respectively Renkin molecular sieving function, dimensionless fraction in the range of 0 to 1 ABL thickness (μm) Villus-fold surface area expansion factor (dimensionless) Madin-Darby Canine Kidney epithelial cell line ABL permeability (cm·s )  apparent permeability of an epithelial cell monolayer, e.g., Caco-2 (cm·s ); can be pH dependent Lipoidal transcellular permeability (cm·s ); can be pH dependent Effective intestinal permeability (cm·s ) in rat single-pass intestinal perfusion (SPIP) or closed-loop Doluisio (CLD) method; can be pH dependent Intrinsic permeability of uncharged permeant (cm·s ); pH independent.   may be calculated from the plot of log   vs.  , as suggested by Fig.  .

Micelles are used as drug carriers and can emulsify drugs that are poorly soluble in water, such as nadifloxacin (NDFX). The purpose of this study was to prepare nanocarriers using APPS to carry NDFX into Yucatan micropig skin. After synthesis of the NDFX nanoparticles by using the hydration method, physical evaluations were carried out that included assessments of particle size and zeta potential, encapsulation efficiency, particle structure by transmission electron microscopy,  P–NMR spectra, and particle stability. Functional evaluations of the nanoparticles included 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assays, skin penetration tests, and fluorescence microscopy observations. The encapsulation efficiency of NDFX in the nanoparticles was approximately 75%. With added magnesium chloride, the nanoparticles remained stably dispersed in aqueous solution for at least 14 days at 25°C under protection from light. In addition, the nanoparticle formulation improved the skin permeability of NDFX.

882,,,[],"The failure of chronic therapy with antibiotics to clear persistent respiratory infection is the key morbidity and mortality factor for patients with chronic lung diseases, primarily due to the presence of biofilm in the lungs. It is hypothesised that carbon sources, such as mannitol, could stimulate the metabolic activity of persister cells within biofilms and restore their susceptibility to antibiotics. The aims of the current study are to: ( ) establish a representative   model of   biofilm lung infection, and ( ) investigate the effects of nebulised mannitol on antibiotic efficacy, focusing on ciprofloxacin, in the eradication of biofilm. Air interface biofilm was cultured onto Snapwell inserts incorporated into a modified pharmacopeia deposition apparatus, the Anderson Cascade Impactor (ACI). Three different formulations including mannitol only, ciprofloxacin only and combined ciprofloxacin and mannitol were nebulised onto the   biofilm using the modified ACI. Antibacterial effectiveness was evaluated using colony-forming units counts, biofilm penetration and scanning electron microscopy. Nebulised mannitol promotes the dispersion of bacteria from the biofilm and demonstrated a synergistic enhancement of the antibacterial efficacy of ciprofloxacin compared to delivery of antibiotic alone. The combination of ciprofloxacin and mannitol may provide an important new strategy to improve antibiotic therapy for the treatment of chronic lung infections. Furthermore, the development of a representative lung model of bacterial biofilm could potentially be used as a platform for future new antimicrobial pre-clinical screening.","Anderson cascade impactor American type cell culture collection Bronchiectasis Cation adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth Ciprofloxacin only Ciprofloxacin and mannitol Centers for disease control Cystic fibrosis Colony-forming unit count Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Crystal violet Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium Dimethyl sulfoxide Extracellular polymeric substances Epithelial voltohmmeter Difference factor Similarity factor Fetal bovine serum Fine particle fraction Geometric standard deviation Hank’s balanced salt solution High performance liquid chromatography Luria-Bertani Mass median aerodynamic diameter

883,,,[],"The induction of autophagy has recently been explored as a promising therapeutic strategy to combat Alzheimer’s disease. Among many other factors, there is evidence that ceramides/dihydroceramides act as mediators of autophagy, although the exact mechanisms underlying such effects are poorly understood. Here, we describe how two dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors (XM461 and XM462) trigger autophagy and reduce amyloid secretion by neurons. Neurons isolated from wild-type and APP/PS1 transgenic mice were exposed to the two dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors to assess their effect on these cell’s protein and lipid profiles. Both dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors increased the autophagic vesicles in wild-type neurons, reflected as an increase in LC3-II, and this was correlated with the accumulation of dihydroceramides and dihydrosphingomyelins. Exposing APP/PS1 transgenic neurons to these inhibitors also produced a 50% reduction in amyloid secretion and/or production. The lipidomic defects triggered by these dihydroceramide desaturase inhibitors were correlated with a loss of S6K activity, witnessed by the changes in S6 phosphorylation, which strongly suggested a reduction of mTORC1 activity. The data obtained strongly suggest that dihydroceramide desaturase 1 activity may modulate autophagy and mTORC1 activity in neurons, inhibiting amyloid secretion and S6K activity. As such, it is tantalizing to propose that dihydroceramide desaturase 1 may be an important therapeutic target to combat amyloidosis.","Amyloid β peptide Alzheimer’s disease Amyloid precursor protein Bafilomycin A Ceramides Dihydroceramide desaturase 1 Dihydroceramide desaturase 2 Dihydroceramides Familial alzheimer’s disease Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B–light chain 3 [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] Nucleoporin p62 Polymerase chain reaction Presenilin 1 Resveratrol Sphingolipids Trans golgi network","This work was supported by a grant from the Centro de Investigacion Biomédica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas (CIBERNED; an initiative of the ISCIII).

The formulations were applied on a skin barrier repair model consisting of   human skin from which SC was removed by stripping. The effect of formulations on the lipid organization and conformational ordering in the regenerated SC were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and small angle X-ray diffraction Application of the formulation containing only one ceramide on regenerating SC resulted in a higher fraction of lipids adopting an orthorhombic organization. A similar fraction of lipids forming an orthorhombic organization was observed after application of a formulation containing two ceramides and a fatty acid on regenerating SC. No effects on the lamellar lipid organization were observed. Application of a formulation containing either a single ceramide or two ceramides and a fatty acid on regenerating SC, resulted in a denser lateral lipid packing of the SC lipids in compromised skin.

PK data used in this study were endogenous/exogenous native IgG and two TMAbs (palivizumab and Motavizumab-YTE) in normal volunteer or familial hypercatabolic hypoproteinemia (FIHH) patient. Several important components were implemented to overcome the limitations of the early mPBPK model, e.g. two-pore model to describe the transcapillary transport of IgG from vascular to interstitial space. Six mPBPK models with different osmotic reflection coefficient (OFC) of transcapillary transport, endocytosis rates (ETR) and plasma clearance for the TMAbs/IgG were tested and the best model was selected using AICc values. The final model consisted of different OFC and ETR values for native IgG and TMAbs, supporting the hypothesis that the dynamics in the endosomal space had an important role in the compliant FcRn salvage mechanism to determine the clearance of TMAbs. The estimated FcRn concentration of FIHH subjects was 2.72 μmol/l. The final two-pore mPBPK model has a better performance for native IgG than previously developed mPBPK model.

Stimulants and drugs that affect the dopaminergic, noradrenergic and/or serotonergic systems are effective treatment and are increasingly prescribed to women at child bearing age. It is consequently important that reliable information on the safety of these drugs in pregnancy is available so that appropriate therapeutic choices can be made. The data on stimulants (methylphenidate and amphetamines) are generally showing that there is no increase in the rate of major congenital anomalies. There are very little data on the use of atomoxetine and guanfacine in pregnancy  There are no data on the use of clonidine for ADHD but the data on its use as an antihypertensive drug have not revealed any serious adverse effect. Bupropion, when used as an antidepressant, does not seem to increase the rate of congenital anomalies. There are practically no data on the possible long-term neurodevelopmental effects of any of these drugs. Most of them are secreted in human milk, but the concentrations in infant’s blood, except for clonidine and amphetamines, have been very low. Breast feeding with clonidine and amphetamines is therefore contraindicated, but there seems to be no safety concerns for the other drugs. The drugs used for the treatment of ADHD are apparently not teratogenic, but due to paucity of data, especially on the long-term neurodevelopmental outcome, the treating physician should reconsider the need of treatment during pregnancy.

These molecules are transferred across the placenta via passive diffusion, carrier-mediated cellular uptake and efflux, and transcytosis pathways. The same mechanisms additionally control the rate and extent of transplacental transfer of drugs taken by the pregnant mother. Essentially all drugs cross the placenta to a certain extent, and some accumulate in the placenta itself at levels that can even exceed those in maternal plasma. Hence, even drugs that are not efficiently transferred across the placenta may indirectly affect fetal development by interfering with placental function.

First, structural identifiability was enabled through re-parametrization and the definition of essential trial design components. Subsequently, requirements for the trial components to yield precise estimation of the PBPK parameters and their inter-individual variability were established using a novel application of population optimal design theory. Finally, the performance of the proposed trial design was assessed using stochastic simulation and estimation. Precise estimation of CLint  and Qh and their inter-individual variability was found to require a trial with two drugs, of which one has an extraction ratio (ER) ≤ 0.27 and the other has an ER ≥ 0.93.

Among them, carvedilol showed the most selectivity on OCTs over MATEs (IC : 3.6 μM for human OCT2, 103 μM for human MATE1 and 202 μM for human MATE2-K) in the cellular assays  , with the selectivity in mice as well. Moreover, carvedilol treatment could significantly decrease cisplatin accumulation and ameliorate its toxicity both   in cells and   in mouse kidney. Our data indicate that selective inhibition of OCTs by carvedilol may protect from cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity by restraining the cellular entry of cisplatin via OCTs, while having no impact on its elimination through MATEs.",Area under curve The maximum concentration Drug-drug interaction Haematoxylin and Eosin staining The half maximal inhibitory concentration Multidrug and toxin extrusions 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium Organic cation transporters Half life Tetraethyl ammonium Time of the maxium concentration,The present study was supported by the National Institute of General Medical Sciences of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) [R01GM099742] and by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [U01FD004320].

898,,,[],"Collagen-induced arthritic (CIA) rats are used commonly for preclinical pharmacologic research into rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Dexamethasone (DEX), a potent corticosteroid (CS), remains an important component in combination therapy for RA. Although sex differences in RA and CS pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) have been documented in humans, there has been no such comprehensive evaluation of sex differences in CIA rats. Paw size measurements were obtained for males and females from four groups of animals: healthy controls, non-drug treated arthritic animals, and both 0.225 and 2.25 mg/kg DEX-treated arthritic animals. A turnover model for disease progression, minimal PBPK model for drug concentrations, and inhibitory indirect response model were applied using population PK/PD modeling. The clearances of DEX were 43% greater in males, but other PK parameters were similar. The temporal profiles of paw swelling exhibited earlier progression, peak edema times, and disease remission in females. DEX suppressed paw edema well in both males and females with similar capacity (  values (=1.0), but DEX potency was less in females with higher   values (0.101   0.015 ng/mL). The pharmacology of DEX was well characterized in CIA rats.

In the pharmaceutical sector, 3DP has been used to develop complex dosage forms of different sizes and structures, dose variations, dose combinations and release characteristics, not possible to produce using traditional manufacturing methods. However, the technology has mainly been focused on polymer-based systems and currently, limited information is available about the potential opportunities for the 3DP of soft materials such as lipids. This review paper emphasises the most commonly used 3DP technologies for soft materials such as inkjet printing, binder jetting, selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography (SLA), fused deposition modeling (FDM) and semi-solid extrusion, with the current status of these technologies for soft materials in biological, food and pharmaceutical applications. The advantages of 3DP, particularly in the pharmaceutical field, are highlighted and an insight is provided about the current studies for lipid-based drug delivery systems evaluating the potential of 3DP to fabricate innovative products. Additionally, the challenges of the 3DP technologies associated with technical processing, regulatory and material issues of lipids are discussed in detail.

904,,,[],"Drug-induced liver injuries (DILI) comprise a significant proportion of adverse drug reactions leading to hospitalizations and death. One frequent DILI is granulomatous inflammation from exposure to harmful metabolites that activate inflammatory pathways of immune cells of the liver, which may act as a barrier to isolate the irritating stimulus and limit tissue damage. Paralleling the accumulation of CFZ precipitates in the liver, granulomatous inflammation was studied to gain insight into its effect on liver structure and function. A structural analog that does not precipitate within macrophages was also studied using micro-analytical approaches. Depleting macrophages was used to inhibit granuloma formation and assess its effect on drug bioaccumulation and toxicity. Granuloma-associated macrophages showed a distinct phenotype, differentiating them from non-granuloma macrophages. Granulomas were induced by insoluble CFZ cargo, but not by the more soluble analog, pointing to precipitation being a factor driving granulomatous inflammation. Granuloma-associated macrophages showed increased activation of lysosomal master-regulator transcription factor EB (TFEB). Inhibiting granuloma formation increased hepatic necrosis and systemic toxicity in CFZ-treated animals. Granuloma-associated macrophages are a specialized cell population equipped to actively sequester and stabilize cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents. Thus, drug-induced granulomas may function as drug sequestering “organoids” –an induced, specialized sub-compartment– to limit tissue damage.",Adverse Drug Reaction Clofazimine Crystal-Like Drug Inclusion Drug-induced liver injury Interleukin-1 Receptor Antagonist Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 Microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 Transcription Factor EB Toll-Like Receptor 9 Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) dUTP Nick-End Labeling,"The authors thank Eric Bushong and Mark Ellisman for helping us with electron microscopy analysis done at the National Center for Microscopy and Imaging Research, University of California San Diego.

The microanalysis was developed for the commercially-available WiTec alpha300R confocal Raman microscope. Alveolar macrophages were isolated and incubated in the presence of pharmaceutical compounds nilotinib, chloroquine, or etravirine. A Raman data processing algorithm was specifically developed to acquire the Raman signals emitted from single-cells and calculate the signal contributions from each of the major molecular components present in cell samples. Our methodology enabled analysis of the most abundant biochemicals present in typical eukaryotic cells and clearly identified “foamy” lipid-laden macrophages throughout cell populations, indicating feasibility for cellular lipid content analysis in the context of different diseases. Single-cell imaging revealed differences in intracellular distribution behavior for each drug; nilotinib underwent phase separation and self-aggregation while chloroquine and etravirine accumulated primarily via lipid partitioning.

In single-dosing period, monkeys received an i.v. infusion of bupropion at 1.5 mg/kg together with an infusion or oral dosing of digoxin, respectively. During multiple-dosing period, bupropion was orally administered q.d. at 7.72 mg/kg for 12-day. Then it was co-administered with an i.v. infusion or oral dosing of digoxin, respectively. Renal expression of OATP4C1 and P-gp was examined. Bupropion significantly increased i.v. digoxin CL  by 1 fold in single-dosing period. But it had no effect on the systemic disposition of digoxin. In multiple-dosing period, bupropion significantly increased oral digoxin CL , CL , CL  and decreased its plasma exposure. Bupropion and its metabolites did not alter creatinine clearance. OATP4C1 was located at the basolateral membrane of proximal tubule cells, while P-gp was on the apical membrane. The effect of multiple dosing with bupropion on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin is more pronounced. The magnitude of increase in digoxin CL  contributed to the decrease in AUC of digoxin in some extent, but certainly is not the major driving force. The lack of systemic exposure after a single dose but a significant decrease in exposure mediated by an increase in the digoxin CL  with repeated dosing is likely to be the more clinically relevant.",Aquaporin 1 Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity Area under the curve from 0 to 48 h Bupropion Renal clearance from 0 to 48 h Total clearance from 0 to 48 h Non-renal clearance from 0 to 48 h Total clearance Filtration clearance Renal clearance Non-renal clearance Creatinine clearance Maximal plasma concentration Digoxin Drug-drug interaction Erythro-hydrobupropion Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase Heart failure Hydroxybupropion Liquid chromatography Tandem mass spectrometry Organic anion-transporting polypeptide P-glycoprotein Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors Tricyclic antidepressants Threo-hydrobupropion Time of maximal plasma concentration Terminal half-life Volume of distribution at steady-state,"This work was supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (81530013 81603188 81370288), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017 M612165), Jiangxi Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2017KY24), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangxi Province (20181BAB215045, 20151BAB215041), the Hospital Foundation of the second affiliated hospital of Nanchang University (2014YNQN2001), the Foundation of Educational Commission of Jiangxi Province (GJJ170156).

Yet, data so far is controversial and this concern is not supported by a clinically relevant age-dependent difference in pharmacokinetics (PK) of paclitaxel. This study assessed whether age is associated with increased risk for paclitaxel-induced neutropenia. Paclitaxel plasma concentration-time data, pooled from multiple different studies, was combined with available respective neutrophil count data during the first treatment cycle. Paclitaxel pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) data was modeled using a non-linear mixed effects approach and a semiphysiological neutropenia model, where systemic paclitaxel exposure was linked to reduced proliferation of neutrophils. The impact of age was evaluated on relevant variables in the model, using a significance threshold of   < 0.005. Paclitaxel PK-PD data was evaluated from 300 patients, with a median age of 65 years (range 23–84 years), containing 116 patients ≥70 years (39%). First cycle neutrophil counts were adequately described by a threshold effect model of paclitaxel on the proliferation rate of neutrophils. Age as a continuous or dichotomous variable (≥70   <70 years) did not significantly impact sensitivity of the bone marrow to paclitaxel nor the average maturation time of neutrophils (both   > 0.005), causing a decline in the respective interindividual variability of <1%. Results from this large retrospective patient cohort do not suggest elderly patients to be at an increased risk of developing paclitaxel-associated neutropenia during the first treatment cycle.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of heat on the permeation of diclofenac through porcine and human skin, comparing four marketed products.  permeation tests (IVPT) were performed on porcine skin from a single miniature pig and human skin from three donors. Skin temperature was maintained at either 32 ± 1°C or 42 ± 1°C to mimic normal and elevated skin temperature conditions, respectively. IVPT studies on porcine and human skin were able to demonstrate heat-induced enhancement in flux and cumulative amount of drug permeated from the four diclofenac products. The pivotal data showed the most significant heat-induced enhancement for the solution, followed by the patch and two gels in decreasing order of significance based on   values. Diclofenac solution showed the highest flux and cumulative amount permeated at both baseline and elevated skin temperature compared to the patch and gels.

So using a novel technology is a necessity to synthesize more effective medications to control this most common cause of dementia. In this study, using nanochelating technology, ALZc3 was synthesized and its therapeutic effects were evaluated in comparison with memantine on a well-known rat model of AD, which is based on Amyloid-βeta (Aβ) injection into the brain. Aβ (1–42) was injected bilaterally into the CA1 area of the hippocampus of male rats and then animals were treated daily by oral administration of Alz-C3, memantine or their vehicles. Activities of antioxidant enzymes catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, caspase-3 activation, and TNF-α expression were evaluated 7 days after Aβ injection. Finally, learning and memory of the rats were assessed by Morris water maze test. ALZc3 and memantine improved memory impairment and antioxidant activity and reduced TNF-α expression, caspase-3 activity and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio in the rat’s hippocampus. The results showed a superiority of ALZC3 compared to memantine in reducing caspase-3, increasing CAT activity in Aβ (1–42)-injected groups and improving apoptosis factor in healthy mice.

The two formulations were pre-dispersed in purified water at 5% w/w (ME90% and 20%, respectively) and orally administered to rats to measure   luminal drug concentrations. FFB precipitated in the stomach due to lipid digestion by gastric lipases and loss of solubilization capacity. This was most significant for ME90%. For ME90%, a high degree of supersaturation was also observed in the duodenum, however, precipitated FFB crystals rapidly re-dissolved. The combination of supersaturation and rapid re-dissolution appeared to drive effective absorption in the upper intestine.

Since silencing complementary targets may offer improved efficacy, this study was undertaken to identify non-viral carriers for combinatorial siRNA delivery for more effective therapy. A library of lipid-substituted polymers from low molecular weight polyethyleneimine (PEI), linoleic acid (LA) and α-linoleic acid (αLA) with amide or thioester linkages was prepared and investigated for delivering Mcl-1, survivin and STAT5A siRNAs in breast cancer cells. The effective polymers formed 80–190 nm particles with similar zeta-potentials, but the serum stability was greater for complexes formed with amide-linked lipid conjugates. The LA and αLA substitutions, with the low molecular weight PEI (1.2 kDa and 2.0 kDa) were able to deliver siRNA effectively to cells and retarded the growth of breast cancer cells. The amide-linked lipid substituents showed higher cellular delivery of siRNA as compared to thioester linkages. Upon combinational delivery of siRNAs, growth of MCF-7 cells was inhibited to a greater extent with 2.0PEI-LA9 mediated delivery of Mcl-1 combined survivin siRNAs as compared to individual siRNAs. The qRT-PCR analysis confirmed the decrease in mRNA levels of target genes with specific siRNAs and 2.0PEI-LA9 was the most effective polymer for delivering siRNAs (either single or in combination).

Plasma samples were collected at 1.5, 4, and 10 h after first oral administration of sulindac. Plasma concentrations of sulindac and its active metabolite (sulindac sulfide) were determined, and pharmacokinetic analysis was performed with NONMEM 7.3. The mean maternal and gestational ages at the time of dosing were 32.5 ± 4.4 (range, 20–41) years and 27.4 ± 4.4 (range, 16.4–33.4) weeks, respectively. In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, one depot compartment model of sulindac with absorption lag time best described the data. The metabolism of sulindac and sulindac sulfide was described using Michaelis-Menten kinetics. In stepwise modeling, gestational age impacted volume of distribution (Vc), and FMO3 rs2266782 was shown by the Michaelis constant to affect conversion of sulindac sulfide to sulindac (K ); these were retained in the final model. Genetic polymorphisms of FMO3 and AOX1 could affect the pharmacokinetics of sulindac in women who undergo preterm labor. The results of this study could help clinicians develop individualized treatment plans for administering sulindac.",Aldehyde oxidase Conditional weighted residuals Flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium Objective function value Single nucleotide polymorphism Stepwise covariate model Visual predictive check,This work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Korean government (MEST) (grant number: NRF-2010-0022544) and the research fund of Hanyang University (grant number: HY-2018-N).,Sulindac population pharmacokinetics preterm labor FMO3 AOX1,2020

ALL cells were treated with PP at various concentrations to determine its effect on cell proliferation. Metabolic function was tested by evaluating Extracellular Acidification Rate (ECAR) and Oxygen Consumption Rate (OCR). Lastly, 3D spheroids were grown, and PP was reformulated into nanoparticles to evaluate distribution effectiveness. PP was found to inhibit ALL proliferation, with varied selectivity to different ALL cell subtypes. We also found that PP’s cell death activity was specific for leukemic cells, as primary normal immune cells were resistant to PP-mediated cell death. Metabolic studies indicated that PP, in part, inhibits mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. To increase the targeting of PP to a hypoxic bone tumor microenvironment (BTME) niche, we successfully encapsulated PP in a nanoparticle drug delivery system and demonstrated that it retained its anti-leukemic activity in a hemosphere assay. We have demonstrated that PP is a novel therapeutic lead compound that counteracts the respiratory reprogramming found in refractory ALL cells and can be effectively formulated into a nanoparticle delivery system to target the BTME.","2-deoxyglucose B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia Adenosine triphosphate Bone marrow Bone marrow stromal cells Bone tumor microenvironment Extracellular acidification rate Electron transport chain Fetal bovine serum Carbonyl cyanide 4-(trifluoromethoxy) phenylhydrazone Hexokinase II Human osteoblasts Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Monoculture Minimal residual disease Nanoparticles Oxygen consumption rate Oxidative phosphorylation Phase dim, buried co-culture ALL cells Pyrvinium pamoate Tris-buffered saline Co-culture ALL cells in suspension","The authors would like to acknowledge Kathleen Brundage, director of the WVU Flow Cytometry & Single Cell Core Facility, for her assistance in acquisition of the flow cytometry data and Aniello Infante, lead bioinformatician with the WVU Genomics Core Facility, for his assistance with gene expression analysis.

The impact of sample handling on the measurement of pH and buffer capacity of aspirates from the upper gastrointestinal tract was evaluated, with a focus on centrifugation and freeze-thaw cycling as factors that can influence results. Since bicarbonate is a key buffer system in the fasted state and is used to represent conditions in the upper intestine  , variations on sample handling were also investigated for bicarbonate-based buffers prepared in the laboratory. Centrifugation and freezing significantly increase pH and decrease buffer capacity in samples obtained by aspiration from the upper gastrointestinal tract in the fasted state and in bicarbonate buffers prepared  . Comparison of data suggested that the buffer system in the small intestine does not derive exclusively from bicarbonates. Measurement of both pH and buffer capacity immediately after aspiration are strongly recommended as “best practice” and should be adopted as the standard procedure for measuring pH and buffer capacity in aspirates from the gastrointestinal tract. Only data obtained in this way provide a valid basis for setting the physiological parameters in physiologically based pharmacokinetic models.",,,Bicarbonates buffer capacity human intestinal fluid pH small intestine stomach,2020

We evaluated three different nanosystems: i) carbon based nanosystem (Graphene Quantum Dots, GQD), ii) polymeric nanoparticles and mesoporous silica (magnetic core mesoporous silica, MMSN). In previous studies, our group has already characterized GQD and MMSN nanoparticles by dynamic light scattering analysis, atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman analysis, fluorescence and absorbance. The polymeric nanoparticle has been characterized by AFM and DLS. All the nanosystems were radiolabeled with 99 m-Tc by. The   biodistribution/tissue deposition analysis evaluation was done using elder (PN270) and young (PN90) mice injected with radioactive nanosystems. The nanosystems used in this study were well-formed as the radiolabeling processes were stable. Biodistribution analysis showed that there is a decrease in the uptake of the nanoparticles in elder mice when compared to young mice, showing that is necessary to increase the initial dose in elder people to achieve the same concentration when compared to young animals. The discrepancy on tissue distribution of nanosystems between young and elder individuals must be monitored, as the therapeutic effect will be different in the groups.

920,,,[],"The intratumoral heterogeneity observed in breast cancer (BC), in particular with regard to cell surface receptor expression, can hinder the success of many targeted cancer therapies. The development of novel therapeutic agents that target more than one receptor can overcome this inherent property of tumors and can facilitate their selective internalization in cancer cells. The goal of this study is to develop a drug combination-loaded nanoparticle (NP) formulation that is actively-targeted to HER2 and EGFR receptors on BC cells. A polymeric NP formulation was prepared which co-encapsulated a synergistic combination of the chemotherapeutic agent, paclitaxel (PTX), and the mTOR inhibitor, everolimus (EVER), and is targeted to HER2 and EGFR receptors on BC cells using antibody Fab fragments as the targeting moieties. The physicochemical characteristics of the dual-targeted formulation (Dual-NP) were evaluated, along with its cytotoxic profile (in both, monolayer and 3D BC models), as well as the degree of cellular uptake in HER2 /EGFR  and HER2 /EGFR  BC cells. Dual-NPs were found to have significantly higher cytotoxicity relative to HER2 mono-targeted (T-NPs) and untargeted NPs (UT-NPs) in HER2 /EGFR  monolayer BC cells after 72 h exposure, while no significant difference was observed in HER2 /EGFR  cells. However, in the HER2 /EGFR  spheroids, the cytotoxicity of Dual-NPs was comparable to that of T-NPs. This was thought to be attributed to the previously reported downregulation of EGFR in 3D in comparison to 2D BC models. Dual-NPs had significantly higher cellular uptake relative to UT-NPs and T-NPs in HER2 /EGFR  BC cells after 24 h exposure, whereas in the HER2 /EGFR  cells, the increase in cellular uptake of the Dual-NPs was not as high as the level achieved in the HER2 /EGFR  cells. Blocking HER2 and EGFR significantly reduced the uptake of T-NPs and Dual-NPs in the HER2 /EGFR  BC cells, demonstrating specific binding to both EGFR and HER2. The dual-targeting strategy developed in this study in conjunction with a potentially promising delivery vector for a synergistic combination therapy can overcome receptor heterogeneity, yielding significant improvements in the cytotoxicity and cellular uptake in BC cells.",,L.H. is the recipient of the CIHR Doctoral Research Award and the Centre for Pharmaceutical Oncology Scholarship.

However, it is well-documented that patients often do not get the prescribed dose out of an inhaler and the deposition of drug is suboptimal, due to incorrect handling of the device and wrong inhalation technique. This study aims to design and fabricate an acoustic dry powder inhaler (ADPI) for monitoring inhalation flow and related drug administration in order to evaluate whether the patient receives the complete dose out of the inhaler. The devices were fabricated using 3D printing and the impact of the acoustic element geometry and printing resolution on the acoustic signal was investigated. Commercial Foradil (formoterol fumarate) capsules were used to validate the availability of the ADPI for medication dose tracking. The acoustic signal was analysed with Partial-Least-Squares (PLS) regression. Indicate that specific acoustic signals could be generated at different air flow rates using a passive acoustic element with specific design features. This acoustic signal could be correlated with the PLS model to the air flow rate. A more distinct sound spectra could be acquired at higher printing resolution. The sound spectra from the ADPI with no capsule, a full capsule and an empty capsule are different which could be used for medication tracking. This study shows that it is possible to evaluate the medication quality of inhaled medicaments by monitoring the acoustic signal generated during the inhalation process.",,,3D printing acoustic element dry powder inhaler inhaler technique medication tracking monitoring of lung disease,2020

In this study, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of hydrophilic gel patch (HG) for EPIT. Milk protein concentrate (MPC)-containing HG was applied to the skin that maintained a barrier function or formed puncture holes with microneedle, and MPC-specific antibodies were measured. The clinical study was conducted involving patients with severe milk allergy. No specific immune response was induced when immunizing to intact skin, and antibody production was observed by forming puncture holes. It was suggested that MPC contained in HG has immunogenicity and a very small amount of MPC was delivered to intact skin. In the clinical study, the symptom induction threshold increased in four of eight subjects, allowing them to consume milk and switch to oral immunotherapy. Although local skin reactions and temporary elevation of specific IgE antibodies were observed, no systemic side effects appeared throughout the study.

Rivastigmine is a widely used therapeutic for ameliorating clinical manifestations of Alzheimer’s disease. However, current treatments require frequent dosing either orally or   transdermal patch that lead to compliance issues and administration errors risking serious adverse effects. Our objective was to develop a smart polymer based delivery system for controlled release of rivastigmine over an extended period following a single subcutaneous injection. Rivastigmine release was optimized by tailoring critical factors including polymer concentration, polymer composition, drug concentration, solvent composition, and drug hydrophobicity (rivastigmine tartrate   base). Optimized   formulation was evaluated   for safety and efficacy. Formulation prepared using PLGA (50:50) at 5%  /  in 95:5 benzyl benzoate: benzoic acid demonstrated desirable controlled drug release characteristics  .

Dissolvable MNAs are fabricated from biocompatible and water-soluble base polymers, and the biocargo to be delivered is integrated with the base polymer when forming the MNAs. The base polymer is selected to provide mechanical strength, desired dissolution characteristics, and compatibility with the biocargo. However, to satisfy regulatory requirements and be utilized in clinical applications, cytotoxicity of the base polymers should also be thoroughly characterized. This study systematically investigated the cytotoxicity of several important carbohydrate-based base polymers used for production of MNAs, including carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), maltodextrin (MD), trehalose (Treh), glucose (Gluc), and hyaluronic acid (HA). Each material was evaluated using   cell-culture methods on relevant mouse and human cells, including MPEK-BL6 mouse keratinocytes, NIH-3T3 mouse fibroblasts, HaCaT human keratinocytes, and NHDF human fibroblasts. A common laboratory cell line, human embryonic kidney cells HEK-293, was also used to allow comparisons to various cytotoxicity studies in the literature. Dissolvable MNA materials were evaluated at concentrations ranging from 3 mg/mL to 80 mg/mL. Qualitative and quantitative analyses of cytotoxicity were performed using optical microscopy, confocal fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry-based assays for cell morphology, viability, necrosis and apoptosis. Results from different methods consistently demonstrated negligible   cytotoxicity of carboxymethyl cellulose, maltodextrin, trehalose and hyaluronic acid. Glucose was observed to be toxic to cells at concentrations higher than 50 mg/mL.

They were thereafter used as absorption membranes separating two compartments mimicking the luminal and serosal side of the intestine  . Membranes were subjected to dispersions of an LBF that had been digested by porcine pancreatin and spiked with the membrane integrity marker Lucifer Yellow (LY). Three fenofibrate-loaded LBFs were used to explore the   relevance of the assay. Of the explored artificial membranes, only LiDo applied to PVDF was compatible with lipolysis by porcine pancreatin. Formulation ranking based on mass transfer in the LiDo model exposed was the same as drug release in single-compartment lipolysis. Ranking based on observed apparent permeability coefficients of fenofibrate with different LBFs were the same as those obtained in a cell-based model.

Uptake of fluorescence-labeled Aβ  was detectable in these cell lines, and the uptake was Na -dependent and inhibitable by deltorphin II. The Na -coupled uptake disappeared at high concentrations of Aβ  due to oligomerization of the peptide. Exposure of the cells to excess iron abolished the uptake. In hCMEC/D3 cells cultured on Transwell filters, the uptake was localized preferentially to the abluminal membrane.

Suspension formulation physicochemical attributes may impact particulate deposition in subcutaneous ( ) tissue. Hence, the utility of synchrotron X-ray micro-computed tomography (μCT) for assessment of spatial distribution of suspension formulation components (PLG microspheres and vehicle) was evaluated in a porcine   tissue model. Optical imaging of dyed vehicle and subsequent microscopic assessment of microsphere deposition was performed in parallel to compare the two approaches. Our findings demonstrate that synchrotron μCT can be applied to the assessment of microsphere and vehicle distribution in   tissue, and that microspheres can also be visualised in the absence of contrast agent using this approach. The technique was deemed superior to optical imaging of macrotomy for the characterisation of microsphere deposition owing to its non-invasive nature and relatively rapid data acquisition time.

The basic methodology and output are generally understood across all functional disciplines. However, this understanding is mostly restricted to traditional methods such as those in simplified kinetic models and void of adequate mechanistic foundation to address questions beyond the observed clinical data. In the past two decades, alternative and more mechanistic methods, particularly for describing absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism (ADME) of drugs have been developed and applied under the general umbrella of physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) methods. Their mechanistic nature gives the ability to ask many other questions which were not traditionally asked and provide some logically and evidenced-based potential answers. Whilst traditional PK methods are mainstream and understood by most scientists, mechanistic absorption models alongside other PBPK approaches are still deemed eclectic, despite making significant strides in the fundamental science as well as regulatory acceptance.

The different talks were tailored to provide a basis or rationale for the subject, introduction to fundamental principles with historical perspective, a critique of the state-of-the-art, examples of successful application of the methods across different phases of the drug development process and the specific standards these mechanistic models should meet to be fully reliable from a regulatory perspective.","American association of pharmaceutical scientists Absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion Active pharmaceutical ingredient Area under the curve Biopharmaceutics classification system Biopharmaceutics drug disposition classification system Bioequivalence Maximal concentration Chemistry, manufacturing and controls Critical micellar concentration Clinically relevant drug product specifications Cytochrome P450 Drug-drug interaction Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics European Medicines Agency Extended-release Fated state simulated intestinal fluid Fed state simulated intestinal fluid High-fat, high-calorie High-fat, low-calorie hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin Immediate-release  correlation  prediction  relation Low-fat, low-calorie Modeling and simulation Modified-release New drug approval new molecular entity Physiologically-based biopharmaceutics modeling Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic(s) Patient centric drug product development Pharmacokinetics Quality by Design Quality control Summary of product characteristics United States Food & Drug Administration",,oral absorption physiologically-based biopharmaceutics modeling physiologically-based pharmacokinetic modeling product quality regulatory,2020
932,,,[],"An investigation of underlying mechanisms of API-polymer interaction patterns has the potential to provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate formulations with superior physical stability and processability. In this study, copovidone was used as a polymeric carrier for several model compounds including clotrimazole, nifedipine, and posaconazole. The varied chemical structures conferred the ability for the model compounds to form distinct interactions with copovidone. Rheology and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) were combined to investigate the molecular pattern and relative strength of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)-polymer interactions. In addition, the impact of the interactions on formulation processability via hot melt extrusion (HME) and physical stability were evaluated. The rheological response of an API-polymer system was found to be highly sensitive to API-polymer interaction, depending both on API chemistry and API-polymer miscibility. In the systems studied, dispersed API induced a stronger plasticizer effect on the polymer matrix compared to crystalline/aggregated API. Correspondingly, the processing torque via HME showed a proportional relationship with the maximum complex viscosity of the API-polymer system. In order to quantitatively evaluate the relative strength of the API-polymer interaction, homogeneously dispersed API-polymer amorphous samples were prepared by HME at an elevated temperature. DSC, XRD, and rheology were employed to confirm the amorphous integrity and homogeneity of the resultant extrudates. Subsequently, the homogeneously dispersed API-polymer amorphous dispersions were interrogated by rheology and NMR to provide a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the nature of the API-polymer interaction, both macroscopically and microscopically. Rheological master curves of frequency sweeps of the extrudates exhibited a strong dependence on the API chemistry and revealed a rank ordering of the relative strength of API-copovidone interactions, in the order of posaconazole > nifedipine > clotrimazole. NMR data provided the means to precisely map the API-polymer interaction pattern and identify the specific sites of interaction from a molecular perspective. Finally, the impact of API-polymer interactions on the physical stability of the resultant extrudates was studied. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the relative strength of the API-polymer interaction was successfully accomplished by utilizing combined rheology and NMR.",,The authors are grateful to MRL for the grant and support of this research.,API-polymer interaction and hot melt extrusion (HME) NMR rheology,2020

In vitro assays combining Caco-2 cell cultures with TEM and confocal microscopy demonstrated passive diffusion, while paracellular integrity and endocytosis activity remain expelled. Oral pharmacokinetics of EFV organogel nanoparticles improve oral bioavailability (F : 249%) and quick absorption compared to EFV suspension.

In this way, our objective was to develop chitosan-coated lipid-core nanocapsules functionalized with BCZ by an organometallic complex using gold-III. The formulation was produced and characterized in relation to physicochemical characteristics. Furthermore, the antitumoral and antiangiogenic activities were evaluated against C6 glioma cell line and chicken embryo chorioallantoic membrane (CAM), respectively. Final formulation showed nanometric size, narrow polydispersity, positive zeta potential and gold clusters size lower than 2 nm. BCZ in aqueous solution (0.01–0.10 μmol L ) did not show cytotoxic activity   against C6 glioma cell line; although, MLNC-Au-BCZ showed cytotoxicity with a median inhibition concentration of 30 nmol L  of BCZ. Moreover, MLNC-Au-BCZ demonstrated cellular internalization dependent on incubation time and BCZ concentration. BCZ solution did not induce significant apoptosis as compared to MLNC-Au-BCZ within 24 h of treatment. CAM assay evidenced potent antiangiogenic activity for MLNC-Au-BCZ, representing a decrease of 5.6 times in BCZ dose comparing to BCZ solution.

936,,,[],"Individuals with the rare genetic disorder Pitt Hopkins Syndrome (PTHS) do not have sufficient expression of the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) which is located on chromosome 18. TCF4 is a basic helix-loop-helix E protein that is critical for the normal development of the nervous system and the brain in humans. PTHS patients lacking sufficient TCF4 frequently display gastrointestinal issues, intellectual disability and breathing problems. PTHS patients also commonly do not speak and display distinctive facial features and seizures. Recent research has proposed that decreased TCF4 expression can lead to the increased translation of the sodium channel Na 1.8. This in turn results in increased after-hyperpolarization as well as altered firing properties. We have recently identified through a drug repurposing screen an FDA approved dihydropyridine calcium antagonist nicardipine used to treat angina, which inhibited Na 1.8. We have now performed behavioral testing in groups of 10 male Tcf4(± ) PTHS mice dosing by oral gavage at 3 mg/kg once a day for 3 weeks using standard methods to assess sociability, nesting, fear conditioning, self-grooming, open field and test of force. Nicardipine returned this spectrum of behavioral deficits in the Tcf4(± ) PTHS mouse model to WT levels and resulted in statistically significant results. These   results in the well characterized Tcf4(± ) PTHS mice may suggest the potential to test this already approved drug further in a clinical study with PTHS patients or suggest the potential for use off label under compassionate use with their physician.",,"These studies were supported by a grant from the Pitt-Hopkins Research Foundation.

937,,,[],"Efficient and safe vehicle that can enhance gene transfer is still needed. Since intracellular cholesterol is known to have an important role in gene delivery and itraconazole alters intracellular cholesterol trafficking, we investigated the effect of itraconazole on pDNA and siRNA delivery. The pDNA and Bcl2 siRNA transfection efficiency was measured by luciferase assay and cytotoxicity. Cellular cholesterol was observed using filipin staining, and intracellular uptake was analyzed by flow cytometry. Lipoplex localization was observed by fluorescent labeling of DNA and lysosome after treatment of itraconazole or co-treatment of itraconazole and bafilomycin A1. Itraconazole enhanced the transfection efficiency of pDNA and siRNA compared to that of control through the accumulation of cholesterol. Bafilomycin A1 diminished the effect of itraconazole on gene delivery and the increment of cholesterol. Itraconazole did not increase the cellular uptake of lipoplex, but increased free pDNA during the endosome-lysosome pathway was observed during the endosome-lysosome pathway. Treating cells with both imipramine and itraconazole caused an additive effect in pDNA and siRNA delivery.

938,,,[],"Bioprospecting is the exploration, extraction and screening of biological material and sometimes indigenous knowledge to discover and develop new drugs and other products. Most antibiotics in current clinical use (eg. β-lactams, aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, macrolides) were discovered using this approach, and there are strong arguments to reprioritize bioprospecting over other strategies in the search for new antibacterial drugs. Academic institutions should be well positioned to lead the early stages of these efforts given their many thousands of locations globally and because they are not constrained by the same commercial considerations as industry. University groups can lack the full complement of knowledge and skills needed though (eg. how to tailor screening strategy to biological source material). In this article, we review three key aspects of the bioprospecting literature (source material and   antibacterial and toxicity testing) and present an integrated multidisciplinary perspective on (a) source material selection, (b) legal, taxonomic and other issues related to source material, (c) cultivation methods, (d) bioassay selection, (e) technical standards available, (f) extract/compound dissolution, (g) use of minimum inhibitory concentration and selectivity index values to identify progressible extracts and compounds, and (h) avoidable pitfalls.

939,,,[],"Lipid-based formulations (LBF) have shown oral bioavailability enhancement of lipophilic drugs, but not necessarily in the case of hydrophobic drugs. This study explored the potential of lipid vehicles to improve the bioavailability of the hydrophobic drug nilotinib comparing a chase dosing approach and lipid suspensions. Nilotinib   bioavailability in rats was determined after administering an aqueous suspension chase dosed with blank olive oil, Captex 1000, Peceol or Capmul MCM, respectively. Absolute bioavailability was determined (relative to an intravenous formulation). Pharmacokinetic parameters were compared to lipid suspensions. Compared to the lipid suspensions, the chase dosed lipids showed a 2- to 7-fold higher bioavailability. Both long chain chase dosed excipients also significantly increased the bioavailability up to 2-fold compared to the aqueous suspension. Deconvolution of the pharmacokinetic data indicated that chase dosing of nilotinib resulted in prolonged absorption compared to the aqueous suspension. Chase dosed LBF enhanced the   bioavailability of nilotinib. Long chain lipids showed superior performance compared to medium chain lipids. Chase dosing appeared to prolong the absorption phase of the drug. Therefore, chase dosing of LBF is favourable compared to lipid suspensions for ‘brick dust’ molecules such as nilotinib.",Medium chain Long chain Monoglyceride Triglyceride Lipid-based formulation,"This work was kindly supported by funding from the Horizon 2020 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Networks programme under grant agreement No. 674909.

940,,,[],"Nelfinavir (NFV), a FDA approved antiretroviral drug, has been reported to exhibit cancer cells growth inhibition and increased apoptosis. However, it requires a higher dose leading to toxicity, thus limiting its potential clinical translation. We aim to develop biodegradable (poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid)) PLGA nanoparticles of nelfinavir and determine their efficacy to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). HIV protease inhibitor, NFV, was loaded into PLGA nanoparticles by double emulsion/solvent evaporation method; and nanoparticles were characterized for physicochemical characteristics including morphology and intracellular uptake. Their anti-cancer efficacy in NSCLC was assessed by in vitro assays including cytotoxicity, cellular migration, colony formation; and 3D spheroid culture mimicking in-vivo tumor microenvironment. Studies were also conducted to elucidate effects on molecular pathways including apoptosis, autophagy, and endoplasmic stress. NFV loaded PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were found to have particle size: 191.1 ± 10.0 nm, zeta potential: −24.3 ± 0.9 mV, % drug loading: 2.5 ± 0.0%; and entrapment efficiency (EE): 30.1 ± 0.5%. NFV NP inhibited proliferation of NSCLC cells compared to NFV and exhibited significant IC  reduction. From the caspase-dependent apoptosis assays and western blot studies (upregulation of ATF3), it was revealed that NFV NP significantly induced ER stress marker ATF3, cleaved PARP and further caused autophagy inhibition (LC3BII upregulation) leading to increased cellular death. In addition, NFV NP were found to be more efficacious in penetrating solid tumors in ex-vivo studies compared to plain NFV. Nelfinavir, a lead HIV protease inhibitor can be repositioned as a NSCLC therapeutic through nanoparticulate delivery. Given its ability to induce apoptosis and efficient tumor penetration capability, NFV loaded PLGA nanoparticulate systems provide a promising delivery system in NSCLC treatment.","4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole Dichloromethane Encapsulation efficiency Fetal bovine serum 50% inhibition concentration International council for harmonization of technical requirements for pharmaceuticals for human use 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide Nelfinavir NFV loaded PLGA nanoparticles Non-small-cell lung cancer Phosphate-buffered saline Polydispersity index Poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) Particle size Poly (vinyl alcohol) Relative humidity Transmission electron microscopy","The author(s) would like to acknowledge the Imaging Facility of CUNY Advanced Science Research Center for instrument use, scientific and technical assistance; and Dr. Aaron Muth, Assistant Professor at St. John’s university for providing EVOS FL fluorescence microscope.

941,,,[],"Dossiers on approved pharmaceutical products must be kept updated and current during the products’ life cycles. The coalition, merger and acquisition along with corporate strategy that pursues efficiency and profitability of pharmaceutical companies have led to the globalization of supply chains for pharmaceutical ingredients and instruments in the post-marketing phase, and progress in manufacturing technologies can improve manufacturing processes during this phase. Regulatory requirements for post-marketing management of pharmaceutical products sometimes differ among countries around the world depending on national/regional policies or situations, even though the basic concepts of each regulation are the same. Therefore, an understanding of up-to-date region specific regulatory management frameworks is important for the optimal provision of pharmaceutical products by pharmaceutical industries. The amendment of the Japanese Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Act (Act No. 63 of 2019) was promulgated in December 2019, and will be enforced from September 2020 onwards. The amended Act sets out regulatory frameworks for post-marketing management systems, including inspection for good manufacturing practice of drugs, quasi-drugs, and gene-, cell-, and tissue-based products; and post-approval change-management protocols. Here, we review these new Japanese post-marketing management frameworks.","Annual report Changes-being-effected Good gene, cellular, and tissue-based product manufacturing practice Good manufacturing practice Marketing authorization holder Ministry of health, labour and welfare Post-approval change-management protocol Prior approval supplement Pharmaceuticals and medical devices agency",The views mentioned here do not necessarily represent the views and findings of the MHLW or the PMDA.,good manufacturing practice post-marketing pharmaceutical management system regulation regulatory framework,2020
942,,,[],"MDCK cells are commonly used to assess drug permeability, but the existence of various strains merits a comparative functional study. Since metformin absorption is largely mediated by transporters and paracellular diffusion, we used it to functionally compare MDCK-wt and MDCK-II. Uptake, bidirectional transport and efflux experiments were performed using different buffers, pH, and a panel of transporter inhibitors. Relative contributions to total transport in both strains were estimated. Metformin uptake into MDCK-wt was linear but saturable in MDCK-II. Uptake into MDCK-wt or -II was promoted at pH 5.4 or 8.4, respectively. Quinidine and cimetidine similarly inhibited uptake in both strains. Lopinavir (PMAT specific) at pH 5.4 or pyrimethamine (MATE specific) at pH 8.4 differentially inhibited MDCK-wt or -II, respectively. Transport at pH 7.4 was absorptive regardless of strains, but secretory (MDCK-II) or absorptive (MDCK-wt) at pH 5.4. Efflux was largely basolateral in both strains. While paracellular permeability was similar between strains, total transport was dominated by transporters in MDCK-II or paracellular diffusion in MDCK-wt. Metformin transport revealed functional differences between MDCK strains.

Process differences introduced by follow-on manufacturers may result in changes in quality and clinical outcomes. This study investigated the impact of production methods on the stability and impurities of liraglutide and semaglutide drug substances/products, and the potential impact on drug quality, efficacy and safety. State-of-the-art analytical methods were used to compare physical and chemical stability, and impurity profiles of drug substances/products from different suppliers. Identified polypeptide-related impurities were evaluated for immunogenicity potential by in silico T cell epitope prediction. Semaglutide immunogenicity in clinical trials (SUSTAIN) was evaluated using a tiered antibody analysis. Manufacturing scale and process strongly impacted the physical stability of the products. Trace metals increased high-molecular-weight protein formation for liraglutide and semaglutide. Synthetic and recombinant liraglutide produced by five suppliers had distinct impurity profiles compared with the originator. In silico evaluation suggested that new impurities could be immunogenic. Immunogenicity of semaglutide in clinical trials was lower than for liraglutide. Differences in manufacturing processes affect chemical/physical stability and impurity profile, and may impact immunogenicity.
